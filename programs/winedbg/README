	This is the core of the Wine debugger.  The reverse assembler
was stolen from Mach more or less intact.  It turns out that there are
two variables that are set differently if you are reverse assembling
16 bit code, and on the whole it seems to work.

NEWS:

	The internal debugger has *tons* more capability than it did before.
I have enclosed some examples that show usage at the end of this file.
New features include:

	1) Ability of debugger to read debug information from wine executable
*and* from Win32 executables.  Local variable and line number information is
also read and processed.

	2) The internal debugger is capable of 'stepping' to the next
line number, just like gdb.  Examples of the commands are:

	step
	stepi
	si
	step 3
	si 5
	next
	nexti
	cont 4
	finish

All of these should be exactly like how gdb does things.

	3) The internal debugger now has a sense of what source file and line
number a given PC is at.  New commands to support this are just like gdb,
and include:

	list
	dir
	show dir

there are a variety of formats of arguments for the list command.  All
permutations supported by gdb should also be supported.

	4) The internal debugger knows about datatypes of various objects,
for both Win32 *and* the debugging information in the wine executable itself.
I have enclosed an example of how this works at the end.

	5) There are more ways the 'b' command can be used to set breakpoints.
Examples are:

	b *0x8190000
	b 1100
	b Usage
	b

I don't think this covers all of the permutations that gdb accepts (this should
be cleaned up someday so that all possibilities are acceptable).

	6)  The 'print' and 'x' commands should behave more or less exactly
as they do under gdb.  The difference is that the way the data is presented
will be slightly different, but the content should be fundamentally the same.

	7) The internal debugger now supports conditional breakpoints, and
automatic display expressions.  An example is at the end of this file.  The
syntax and usage should be identical to that of gdb.

	8) Type casts can be made from within the debugger, but they currently
don't work with typedef'ed types.  They only work with builtin types and
named structures unions, etc.  The problem is that internally we don't always
record the typedefed names of structures, so we have no guarantee that we
would know what each type is.  This can be fixed, of course -  it just takes
more memory.  Note that in some cases, typedefed structures could be cast
using '(struct typedfname)' instead of '(typedfname)'.   Technically this
isn't quite correct, but if and when the rest of this stuff gets fixed,
this would need to get corrected too.

NOTES:

	If it weren't for the fact that gdb doesn't grok the Win32 debug
information, you could just use gdb.  The internal debugger should be able
to read and use debugging information for both Win32 and also for the
Wine executable, making it possible to debug the combination of the two
together as if it were one large (very large) entity.

LIMITATIONS AND DIFFERENCES FROM GDB:

	You cannot set a breakpoint by file and line number as you can
with gdb.  Adding support for this wouldn't be all that tough, I guess, but
it would be a nuisance.   You can set a breakpoint given a function and
line number, however.  An example would be 'b main:2993'.  It turns out
that the way the internal data structures are arranged it is a whole lot
easier to do things in this way than it would be to try and get the
source:line type of breakpoint working, but it would probably be worth it
to try.

	Getting stack traces through Wine itself can be a bit tricky.
This is because by default the thing is built with optimization
enabled, and as a result sometimes functions don't get frames, and
lots of variables are optimized into registers.  You can turn off
optimization for a few key source files if it will help you.

	Memory consumption is getting to be a real problem.  I think 32Mb is
no longer sufficient to debug wine - 48 or 64 is probably a whole lot better.
Unfortunately I cannot shut down X to save memory :-).

EXAMPLES:

	Here is an example of how I tracked down a bug in Wine.  The program
is something that just maps and dumps the contents of a Win32 executable.
It was dying for some reason.
Note that this example is rather old and does not necessarily use current
syntax !

*******************************************************************
Notice that you can step through the thunks into our own transfer
routines.   You will notice that the source line displays as something
like:

390	0385 stdcall MapViewOfFile(long long long long long) MapViewOfFile

This is just the source line from the spec file that caused the transfer
routine to be generated.  From this you can step again, and you step
into the relay logging code - keep stepping and you eventually step into
the actual function that does the dirty work.

	At this point an examination of the source to the Win32 program
and an examination of the source to win32/file.s showed where the problem
was.  When you specify 0 for the size of the object in CreateFileMapping,
it is supposed to use the entire size of the file as the size of the
object.  Instead we were just blindly copying the number over.
