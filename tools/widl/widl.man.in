.SH NAME
widl \- Wine Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B widl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIinfile\fR.idl
.br
.B widl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fB--dlldata-only\fR \fIname1\fR [\fIname2\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When no options are used the program will generate a header file, and possibly
client and server stubs, proxy and dlldata files, a typelib, and a UUID file,
depending on the contents of the IDL file.  If any of the options \fB-c\fR,
\fB-h\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-s\fR, \fB-t\fR, or \fB-u\fR are given,
.B widl
will only generate the requested files, and no others.  When run with
\fB--dlldata-only\fR, widl will only generate a dlldata file, and it will
contain a list of the names passed as arguments.  Usually the way this file
is updated is that each time
.B widl
is run, it reads any existing dlldata file, and if necessary regenerates it
with the same list of names, but with the present proxy file included.
.PP
When run without any arguments,
.B widl
will print a help message.
