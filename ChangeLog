	* windows/dinput.c: Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Updated to use the latest COM macros, ICOM_VTABLE and ICOM_THIS.
	Added the interface implementation structures.
	I remembered from an email that even when asked for a
	IDirectInputDeviceA what was returned was an IDirectInputDevice2A so I
	considered that we would only implement the latter. The
	IDirectInputDeviceA_xxx methods have been renamed to
	IDirectInputDevice2A_xxx, and we always return our IDirectInputDevice2A
	implementation as before.
	Renamed the implementation structures to XxxImpl.

	Use latest COM macros
	Defined the IDirectInputDeviceA interface independently from
	IDirectInputDevice2A.
	Removed the 32 suffix of the interfaces. Hopefully this will not
	cause any problem with the renaming.
	Moved the implementation specific stuff to dinput.c (well, the
	interfaces at least).

	invalidated before). Bug found and (other) fix suggested by
	<daniel@mat.utfsm.cl> Daniel Serpell.

	* ole/olefont.c: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	use its color capabilities.

	* console/interface.c, include/console.h:
	Joseph Pranevich <jpranevich@lycos.com>

	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Modified so that they do not use the VTABLE_FUNC macros that performed
	casts of all methods put in the jump table. I find it too risky to use
	such macros because nothing guarantees that you actually put the right
	method at the right place or that the prototype is right.

	* include/wine/obj_moniker.h, include/wine/obj_storage.h, ole/storage.c:
	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Updated to use the latest COM macros. Defined more interfaces and API

	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Moved some definitions to their proper include file.

	* include/wine/obj_clientserver.h, include/wine/obj_misc.h:
	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Fixed some ICOM_INHERIT stuff and added new related API functions.

	* include/wine/obj_base.h: Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Added new API. Part of it was in 'include/objbase.h' before and part
	of it is new. Now it also contains 'WINE_StringFromCLSID'. It's not
	perfect but it's better than having it in 'include/objbase.h'.

	* dlls/advapi32/crypt.c, dlls/ntdll/nt.c, graphics/x11drv/graphics.c, scheduler/synchro.c, controls/scroll.c:
	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Fixed a number of warnings concerning the matching of the printf
	format string and the associated parameters (actually it's mostly
	TRACE and FIXMEs).

	* include/mmsystem.h, multimedia/mmio.c, multimedia/mmsystem.c, relay32/winmm.spec:
	Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	mmioDescend: fixed FIND_xxxx, verified with mciavi32.dll.
	mciLoadCommandResource32: second arg is wide string

	Francois Gouget <fgouget@psn.net>
	Changed ICOM_THIS definition.

	* dlls/version/info.c, include/ver.h:
	Bertho Stultiens <bertho@panter.soci.aau.dk>
	Renamed VS_VERSION_INFOxx structure to VS_VERSION_INFO_STRUCTxx.
	The VS_VERSION_INFO is a simple define and would cause confusion.
	Also corrected the VS_xx_INFO defines not to use MAKEINTRESOURCE16 for win32.

	* configure, configure.in: Steffen Moeller <moeller@ebi.ac.uk>
	"Configure finished" message suggests to call make when make depend
	was successful.

	* */*: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Optimized include/*.h: (recursively) include all headers needed by
	this .h file, but only those. Necessary fixes to a lot of .c files,
	started optimizing "windows.h" away from some of them. Moved
	GetCurrentTask prototype to wine/winbase16.h.

	* include/commctrl.h, include/listview.h, dlls/comctl32/listview.c:
	Luc Tourangeau <luc@macadamian.com>

	Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Added some new dosmod communication possibilities, including
	activating a dosmod-specific setitimer(), and the capture of some
	common signals, which is returned to Wine (previously a SIGILL

	* relay32/user32.spec: Juergen Schmied <juergen.schmied@metronet.de>
	Dest buffer was printed out as str.

	* misc/ver.c: Juergen Schmied <juergen.schmied@metronet.de>

	* files/directory.c: Huw D M Davies <daviesh@abacus.physics.ox.ac.uk>
	Fix GetTempPath32 if count=0.

	* configure, configure.in, include/config.h.in, include/multimedia.h, multimedia/audio.c, multimedia/dsound.c, multimedia/init.c, multimedia/mcicda.c, multimedia/mcimidi.c, multimedia/midi.c, multimedia/mixer.c, multimedia/mmaux.c:
	Todd Vierling <tv@pobox.com>
	- add -lossaudio if needed, and a check for <soundcard.h>, to configure.in
	  (run autoconf after this).  Note that the check has been altered to break
	  out of the AC_CHECK_HEADERS after the first match - this is so
	  <sys/soundcard.h>, if found on NetBSD (a `real' OSS), will not conflict
	  with the emulated ossaudio.
	- check for <soundcard.h> along with the other two in a mutually-exclusive
	  manner in the various *.c files that need it; change include of
	  "mmsystem.h" to "multimedia.h" so this logic is all in one place
	- change mcicda.c to allow for CD audio manipulation on NetBSD.  This
	  includes:
	  * changing ioctl() calls to be NON-SPLIT with exactly 3 args; on NetBSD
	    ossaudio, ioctl() is #defined to be _oss_ioctl by <soundcard.h>, and
	    neither splitting with #-directives nor a two-arg ioctl work;
	  * changing the #if logic to allow both FreeBSD and NetBSD to share the
	    appropriate code blocks
	- block out MIDI code for NetBSD (init.c) and/or missing SNDCTL_MIDI_INFO
	  (midi.c, mcimidi.c).  NetBSD's OSS emulation does not (yet) support MIDI.
	Thanks go to mycroft@netbsd.org for the 99% bulk of this work.

	* windows/dialog.c, relay32/user32.spec:
	Sat Oct 10 12:00:00 1998  Juergen Schmied <juergen.schmied@metronet.de>
	Stub CreateDialogIndirectParamAorW.

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.in:
	Uwe Bonnes <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt>
	Don't install object files when --disable-lib is selected.

	* debugger/hash.c, debugger/msc.c:
	Uwe Bonnes <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt>
	Don't print name for 32 bit lib multiple times.
	Clean up printing in DEBUG_ProcessDeferredDebug.

	* memory/heap.c, dlls/comctl32/tab.c, controls/combo.c:
	David Luyer <luyer@ucs.uwa.edu.au>
	Small fixes.

	* files/drive.c: Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@td.org.uit.no>
	Bugfix: Changed GetDriveType32A(NULL) to use cwd's root.

	* ole/typelib.c, ole/compobj.c, ole/ifs.c, ole/moniker.c, ole/ole2.c, ole/ole2disp.c, ole/ole2nls.c, ole/olecli.c, ole/olesvr.c, ole/storage.c, misc/ntdll.c, misc/registry.c:
	Matthew Becker <mbecker@glasscity.net>
	Documentation corrections/standardizations.

	* multimedia/audio.c, multimedia/init.c, multimedia/mcianim.c, multimedia/mcicda.c, multimedia/mcistring.c, multimedia/midi.c, multimedia/mmsystem.c, include/mmsystem.h, include/multimedia.h:
	Eric Pouech  <eric.pouech@lemel.fr>
	Started coding 32 bit MCI handling.
	Added Open/Close to low-level MCI drivers (audio, midi, anim, cda).
	Wrote MCI MIDI support.

	* graphics/x11drv/graphics.c: Rein Klazes <rklazes@casema.net>
	Yet another improvement to the bezier code.

	* windows/message.c: Rein Klazes <rklazes@casema.net>
	GetTickCounts() has a granularity in windows of 25 msec's.
	Girotel's serial communication appears to depend on it, so I guess
	it's a feature...

	* misc/comm.c: Rein Klazes <rklazes@casema.net>
	Update the modemn status bit that indicates whether the RLSD line is
	active in every call to GetCommError(). This is not the proper place,
	but since wine doesn't do any event-stuff...
	Fixed some TRACE call's faced with non zero terminated strings.
	Restore the terminal state at CloseCommt to the state it was at
	OpenComm(), so the modem will go off-hook.

	* loader/module.c: Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>
	GetModuleFileName32A() returns long filename if app sets osversion >=
	4.0. Also moved the long filename hackery to GetLongPathName32A() so
	it can be used by win32 programs.

	* files/dos_fs.c: Alexander Larsson <alla@lysator.liu.se>
	GetLongPathName32A() returns dos format long filename instead of unix
	format.

	Small fixes.

	* relay32/shell32.spec, dlls/shell32/shellord.c:

	Added SHFlushClipboard.

	* relay32/comctl32.spec, include/commctrl.h, dlls/comctl32/comctl32undoc.c:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Fixed some undocumented functions.
	Changed algorithm in DPA_QuickSort().
	Fixed heap creation/destruction and control [un]registration in
	ComCtl32LibMain().

	* dlls/comctl32/header.c: Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Fixed a bug.

	* include/tooltips.h, dlls/comctl32/tooltips.c:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Added tracking support and fixed loading of resource strings.
	Added unregister code.

	* include/debug.h, include/debugdefs.h, include/ipaddress.h, include/nativefont.h, dlls/comctl32/Makefile.in, dlls/comctl32/commctrl.c, dlls/comctl32/ipaddress.c, dlls/comctl32/nativefont.c:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Added IPAddress and NativeFont controls.

	* include/imagelist.h, dlls/comctl32/imagelist.c:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Some minor improvements.

	* include/toolbar.h, dlls/comctl32/toolbar.c:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Improved drawing and placement code. Explorer style common dialogs are
	looking good now.

	* objects/cursoricon.c: Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Fixed bug in DrawIconEx32().

	* misc/main.c: Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Improved GetSystemInformation32[A/W].

	* windows/nonclient.c, relay32/user32.spec, include/windows.h, if1632/user.spec:
	Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Added DrawCaption[16/32] and DrawCaptionTemp[16/32A/32W].
	Fixed handling of WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW.

	* documentation/common_controls: Eric Kohl <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>
	Updated.

	* windows/event.c, windows/keyboard.c, include/keyboard.h:
	David Faure <faure@kde.org>
	Added KEYBOARD_UpdateState, to read the modifiers when the wine app is
	activated. Uses the new KEYBOARD_UpdateOneState.
	Fixed a problem with menu accelerators (Alt-letter generates a down
	arrow event which beeps if not filtered).
	Speeded up ToAscii16/32() a little bit.

	* debugger/break.c, debugger/db_disasm.c, debugger/dbg.y, debugger/expr.c, debugger/source.c, debugger/types.c:
	Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Made Wine's debugger work satisfactorily with DOS apps.
	Perhaps dereferencing work better for Win16 apps too now, but
	it appears the debugger core wasn't designed for segmentation.

	* msdos/dpmi.c: Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Simulates DPMI memory map by converting lower-MB segment base
	addresses as necessary. Implemented allocating/freeing DOS memory
	blocks. Added XMS hook. (DPMI remains disabled by default until
	someone implements the raw mode switch entry points pkunzip needs.)

	* msdos/int21.c: Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	I think it's time to rethink the HFILE16_TO_HFILE32 strategy,
	can't keep working around flaws in it like this (now stdio
	was getting closed when programs close handles >=5)

	* msdos/xms.c, msdos/Makefile.in, msdos/int2f.c:
	Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Implemented basic XMS functions. wcb.exe (Win16 disassembler) now
	seems to work fine under Wine.

	* loader/dos/dosvm.c, loader/dos/module.c, include/dosexe.h, include/miscemu.h:
	Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Moved some system dependencies to loader/dos/dosvm.c. Implemented
	environmental argv[0] passing to DOS apps. Added XMS hooks.

	* debugger/stabs.c: Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>
	Added a memset() to prevent a debugger segfault caused by
	uninitialized pointers in the stabs lookup tables.

	* graphics/ddraw.c: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	A few fixes.

	* relay32/ntdll.spec: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Added RtlAllocateAndInitializeSid entry.

	* loader/Makefile.in, loader/elf.c, loader/module.c, loader/pe_image.c, include/config.h.in, include/module.h, include/pe_image.h, include/peexe.h, configure, configure.in:
	Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Generic dynamic dll loader using dl*() API.
	Includes: stdcall->cdecl mapping ability, snooping.
	(Tested only with glide2x.dll -> libglide2x.so)

	* multimedia/init.c, multimedia/time.c, include/mmsystem.h, include/multimedia.h:
	Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Added win32 enhanced functionality to timer callbacks.

	* win32/console.c: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Added bad hacks so WriteConsoleOutput works on vt100 and PeekMessage
	does at least a bit of keyboard input.

	* relay32/snoop.c: Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	Should display again.

Sat Oct 10 15:52:46 1998  Alexandre Julliard  <julliard@winehq.com>

	* windows/dialog.c: Dave Pickles <davep@nugate.demon.co.uk>
	Implemented DS_CENTER dialog style.

	* misc/main.c: Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@chanae.alphanet.ch>
	Added function to build the Windows numeric language ID from language,
	code, charset and dialect strings, like used by Unix LANG variable.

	* ole/ole2nls.c, ole/nls/README, include/winnls.h, ole/nls/*.nls:
	Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@chanae.alphanet.ch>
	More NLS data.

	* graphics/ddraw.c: Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	Fixed a lot of bugs in ddraw.c to make xlib support work.
	Runs successfully TR2Demo and Jazz Jackrabbit II Demo!

	* objects/gdiobj.c: Cliff Wright <cliff@snipe444.org>
	Added DC object type to the list of valid objects that can be deleted
	by DeleteObject32.

Sun Oct  4 18:20:29 1998  Alexandre Julliard  <julliard@winehq.com>
