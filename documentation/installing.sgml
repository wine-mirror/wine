        <para>
          A Windows installation consists of many different parts.

            <para>
              Registry. Many keys are supposed to exist and contain
              meaningful data, even in a newly-installed Windows.

              Directory structure. Applications expect to find and/or
              install things in specific predetermined locations. Most
              of these directories are expected to exist. But unlike
              Unix directory structures, most of these locations are
              not hardcoded, and can be queried via the Windows API
              and the registry. This places additional requirements on
              a Wine installation.

              System DLLs. In Windows, these usually reside in the
              <filename>system</filename> (or
              <filename>system32</filename>) directories. Some Windows
              applications check for their existence in these
              directories before attempting to load them. While Wine
              is able to load its own internal DLLs
              (<filename>.so</filename> files) when the application
              asks for a DLL, Wine does not simulate the existence of
              nonexisting files.

        <para>
          While the users are of course free to set up everything
          themselves, the Wine team will make the automated Wine
          installation script, <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename>,
          do everything we find necessary to do; running the
          conventional <command>configure && make depend && make && make
            install</command> cycle is thus not recommended, unless
          you know what you're doing. At the moment,
          <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> is able to create a
          configuration file, install the registry, and create the
          directory structure itself.

      <sect2>
        <title>The Registry</title>
        <para>
          The default registry is in the file
          <filename>winedefault.reg</filename>. It contains directory
          paths, class IDs, and more; it must be installed before most
          <filename>INSTALL.EXE</filename> or
          <filename>SETUP.EXE</filename> applications will work. The
          registry is covered in more detail in an earlier article.

        <title>Directory Structure</title>
        <para>
          Here's the fundamental layout that Windows applications and
          installers expect. Without it, they seldom operate
          correctly.

          Wine emulates drives by placing their virtual drive roots to
          user-configurable points in the Unix filesystem, so it's
          your choice where <medialabel>C:</medialabel>'s root should
          be (<filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> will even ask
          you). If you choose, say, <filename>/var/wine</filename>, as
          the root of your virtual drive <medialabel>C</medialabel>,
          then you'd put this in your <filename>wine.conf</filename>:

          With this configuration, what windows apps think of as
          "c:\windows\system" would map to
          <filename>/var/wine/windows/system</filename> in the UNIX
          filesystem. Note that you need to specify
          <literal>Filesystem=win95</literal>, NOT
          <literal>Filesystem=unix</literal>, to make Wine simulate a
          Windows-compatible (case-insensitive) filesystem, otherwise
          most apps won't work.

      <sect2>
        <title>System DLLs</title>
        <para>
          The Wine team has determined that it is necessary to create
          fake DLL files to trick many applications that check for
          file existence to determine whether a particular feature
          (such as Winsock and its TCP/IP networking) is available. If
          this is a problem for you, you can create empty files in the
          <filename>system</filename> directory to make the
          application think it's there, and Wine's built-in DLL will
          be loaded when the application actually asks for it.
          (Unfortunately, <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> does
          not create such empty files itself.)
        </para>
        <para>
          Applications sometimes also try to inspect the version
          resources from the physical files (for example, to determine
          the DirectX version). Empty files will not do in this case,
          it is rather necessary to install files with complete
          version resources. This problem is currently being worked
          on. In the meantime, you may still need to grab some real
          DLL files to fool these apps with.
        </para>
        <para>
          And there are of course DLLs that wine does not currently
          implement very well (or at all). If you do not have a real
          Windows you can steal necessary DLLs from, you can always
          get some from a DLL archive such as
          <ulink url="http://solo.abac.com/dllarchive/">http://solo.abac.com/dllarchive/</ulink>.

        A major goal of Wine is to allow users to run Windows programs
        without having to install Windows on their machine. Wine
        implements the functionality of the main DLL's usually
        provided with Windows. Therefore, once Wine is finished, you
        will not need to have windows installed to use Wine.

        Because Wine is not yet complete, some programs will work
        better with native Windows DLL's than with Wine's
        replacements. Wine has been designed to make this possible.
        Here are some tips by Juergen Schmied (and others) on how to
        proceed. This assumes that your
        <filename>C:\windows</filename> directory in the configuration
        file does not point to a native Windows installation but is in
        a separate Unix file system. (For instance, <quote>C:\windows</quote> is
        really subdirectory <quote>windows</quote> located in
        <quote>/home/ego/wine/drives/c</quote>).

      <title>Dealing With FAT/VFAT Partitions</title>
      <para>
        written by Steven Elliott (elliotsl@mindspring.com)
      </para>

        (Extracted from <filename>wine/documentation/linux-fat-permissions</filename>)
      </para>
      <para>
        This document describes how FAT and
        VFAT file system permissions work in Linux
        with a focus on configuring them for Wine.
      </para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
          Linux is able to access DOS and Windows file systems using
          either the FAT (older 8.3 DOS filesystems) or VFAT (newer
          Windows 95 or later long filename filesystems) modules.
          Mounted FAT or VFAT filesystems provide the primary means
          for which existing applications and their data are accessed
          through Wine for dual boot (Linux + Windows) systems.
        </para>
        <para>
          Wine maps mounted FAT filesystems, such as
          <filename>/c</filename>, to driver letters, such as
          <quote>c:</quote>, as indicated by the
          <filename>wine.conf</filename> file.  The following excerpt
          from a <filename>wine.conf</filename> file does this:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
[Drive C]
Path=/c
Type=hd
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          Although VFAT filesystems are preferable to FAT filesystems
          for their long filename support the term <quote>FAT</quote>
          will be used throughout the remainder of this document to
          refer to FAT filesystems and their derivatives. Also,
          <quote>/c</quote> will be used as the FAT mount point in
          examples throughout this document.
        </para>
        <para>
          Most modern Linux distributions either detect or allow
          existing FAT file systems to be configured so that can be
          mounted, in a location such as <filename>/c</filename>,
          either persistently (on bootup) or on an as needed basis. In
          either case, by default, the permissions will probably be
          configured so that they look something like:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>cd /c</userinput>
<prompt>/c></prompt><userinput>ls -l</userinput>

        </screen>
        <para>
          where all the files are owned by "root", are in the "root"
          group and are only writable by "root"
          (<literal>755</literal> permissions). This is restrictive in
          that it requires that Wine be run as root in order for
          applications to be able to write to any part of the
          filesystem.
        </para>
        <para>
          There three major approaches to overcoming the restrictive
          permissions mentioned in the previous paragraph:

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>
          Each approach will be discussed in the following sections.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Running Wine as root</title>
        <para>
          Running Wine as root is the easiest and most thorough way of giving
          applications that Wine runs unrestricted access to FAT files systems.
          Running wine as root also allows applications to do things unrelated
          to FAT filesystems, such as listening to ports that are less than
          1024.  Running Wine as root is dangerous since there is no limit to
          what the application can do to the system.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Mounting FAT filesystems</title>
        <para>
          The FAT filesystem can be mounted with permissions less restrictive
          than the default.  This can be done by either changing the user that
          mounts the FAT filesystem or by explicitly changing the permissions
          that the FAT filesystem is mounted with.  The permissions are
          inherited from the process that mounts the FAT filesystem.  Since the
          process that mounts the FAT filesystem is usually a startup script
          running as root the FAT filesystem inherits root's permissions.  This
          results in the files on the FAT filesystem having permissions similar
          to files created by root.  For example:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>whoami</userinput>
<computeroutput>root</computeroutput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>touch root_file</userinput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>ls -l root_file</userinput>
<computeroutput></computeroutput>-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Dec 10 00:20 root_file
        </screen>
        <para>
          which matches the owner, group and permissions of files seen
          on the FAT filesystem except for the missing 'x's.  The
          permissions on the FAT filesystem can be changed by changing
          root's umask (unset permissions bits).  For example:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umount /c</userinput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umask</userinput>
<computeroutput>022</computeroutput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umask 073</userinput>

        </screen>
        <para>
          Mounting the FAT filesystem with a umask of
          <literal>000</literal> gives all users complete control over
          it. Explicitly specifying the permissions of the FAT
          filesystem when it is mounted provides additional control.
          There are three mount options that are relevant to FAT
          permissions: <literal>uid</literal>, <literal>gid</literal>
          and <literal>umask</literal>.  They can each be specified
          when the filesystem is manually mounted.  For example:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umount /c</userinput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>mount -o uid=500 -o gid=500 -o umask=002 /c</userinput>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>cd /c</userinput>
<prompt>/c></prompt><userinput>ls -l</userinput>
<computeroutput>-rwxrwxr-x   1 sle      sle            91 Oct 10 17:58 autoexec.bat
-rwxrwxr-x   1 sle      sle           245 Oct 10 17:58 config.sys
drwxrwxr-x  41 sle      sle         16384 Dec 30  1998 windows</computeroutput>
        </screen>
        <para>
          which gives "sle" complete control over
          <filename>/c</filename>.  The options listed above can be
          made permanent by adding them to the
          <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>grep /c /etc/fstab</userinput>
<computeroutput>/dev/hda1  /c  vfat  uid=500,gid=500,umask=002,exec,dev,suid,rw 1 1</computeroutput>
        </screen>
        <para>
          Note that the umask of <literal>002</literal> is common in
          the user private group file permission scheme.  On FAT file
          systems this umask assures that all files are fully
          accessible by all users in the specified group
          (<literal>gid</literal>).

        <title>Shadowing FAT filesystems</title>
        <para>
          Shadowing provides a finer granularity of control.  Parts of
          the original FAT filesystem can be copied so that the
          application can safely work with those copied parts while
          the application continue to directly read the remaining
          parts.  This is done with symbolic links. For example,
          consider a system where an application named
          <application>AnApp</application> must be able to read and
          write to the <filename>c:\windows</filename> and
          <filename>c:\AnApp</filename> directories as well as have
          read access to the entire FAT filesystem.  On this system
          the FAT filesystem has default permissions which should not
          be changed for security reasons or can not be changed due to
          lack of root access.  On this system a shadow directory
          might be set up in the following manner:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt>~></prompt><userinput>cd /</userinput>
<prompt>/></prompt><userinput>mkdir c_shadow</userinput>
<prompt>/></prompt><userinput>cd c_shadow</userinput>
<prompt>/c_shadow></prompt><userinput>ln -s /c_/* .</userinput>
<prompt>/c_shadow></prompt><userinput>rm windows AnApp</userinput>
<prompt>/c_shadow></prompt><userinput>cp -R /c_/{windows,AnApp} .</userinput>
<prompt>/c_shadow></prompt><userinput>chmod -R 777 windows AnApp</userinput>
<prompt>/c_shadow></prompt><userinput>perl -p -i -e 's|/c$|/c_shadow|g' /usr/local/etc/wine.conf</userinput>
        </screen>
        <para>
          The above gives everyone complete read and write access to
          the <filename>windows</filename> and
          <filename>AnApp</filename> directories while only root has
          write access to all other directories.

        Now that I have said that. ASPI is a direct link to SCSI devices from
        windows programs. ASPI just forwards the SCSI commands that programs send
        to it to the SCSI bus.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you use the wrong scsi device in your setup file, you can send
        completely bogus commands to the wrong device - An example would be
        formatting your hard drives (assuming the device gave you permission -
        if you're running as root, all bets are off).
      </para>
      <para>
        So please make sure that **all** SCSI devices not needed by the program 
        have their permissions set as restricted as possible !

              Linux by default uses smaller scsi buffers than Windows.
