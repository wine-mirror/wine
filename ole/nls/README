There is some confusion about the format of numeral fields;
it seems to me it is field dependant, as fields

LOCALE_ILANGUAGE and LOCALE_IDEFAULTLANGUAGE use hexadecimal,
while LOCALE_ICOUNTRY, LOCALE_IDEFAULTCOUNTRY, LOCALE_IDEFAULTCODEPAGE
and LOCALE_IDEFAULTANSICODEPAGE use decimal.

I'll appreciate info on the others numeric fields; and a confirmation
about the numeric fields I told above.

I have also doubts for the alphanumeric fields; what character encoding
should be used for non ascii strings ? DOS code page ? Windows code page ?
Unix standard encoding (what I did until now) ? Unicode ?

Here is how I completed some fields:

* month/weekdays names: from the locales definitions of glibc and Java.
* native monetary symbol: from the locales definitions of glibc.
* monetary international symbols: from documents of my bank :)
* DOS code page: from MS-DOS manuals, and some notes from IBM PC-DOS Y2K update
* Windows code page: from Wine definitions of cp125[1234567]
* Country abbreviation: From iso 3 letters country codes
* Country Number: it seems to be the country code used for telephone nubers
	(maybe Windows use it for PPP dialers etc ?)
* Language abbreviation: it is the iso 2 letter language code + a third
	letter to identify the country.
* Language number: from the include files (*.h) of the FreeType librairies
	(freetype is a library to manipulate True Type fonts, and those TTF
	have several strings telling copyright, face name, etc; the strings
	can be in several languages and for Microsoft platforms the Windows
	language code numbers are used to identify language).
	Look at ole/ole2nls.c for a comprehensive list of language code
	numbers and iso 2 letters names.
* Calendar type: I have not info on it, but I guess it is to identify
	if the calendar is a gregorian one, or another (eg arabic traditional,
	etc). As I have, for months names etc, only info on gragorian
	calendars I set it to "1" for all files, as it seems to indicate
	a gregorian calendar.
