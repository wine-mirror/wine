        <sect3>
          <title>The [Drive X] Section</title>
          <para>
	    These sections are supposed to make certain Unix
	    directory locations accessible to Wine as a DOS/Windows drive
	    (drive 'X:') and thus accessible to Windows programs
	    under the drive name you specified.
	    Every DOS/Windows program sort of expects at least a C: drive (and
	    sometimes also an A: floppy drive), so your config file should
	    at least contain the corresponding sections, [Drive C] and
	    [Drive A].
	    You need to decide on whether you want to use an existing Windows
	    partition as the C drive or whether you want to create your own
	    Wine drive C directory tree somewhere (take care about
	    permissions !).
            Each drive section may specify up to 6 different settings
	    as explained below.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>[Drive X]</programlisting>
            The above line begins the section for a drive whose letter is X
	    (DOS notation: drive 'X:').
	    You could e.g. create an equivalent to a drive 'C:'
	    under DOS/Windows by using a [Drive C] section name.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Path" = "/dir/to/path"</programlisting>
	    This specifies the directory where the drive will begin.
	    When Wine is browsing in drive X, it will be able
	    to see the files that are in the directory
	    <filename>/dir/to/path</filename> and below.
	    (note that symlinks to directories won't get included !
	    see "<link linkend="dirsymlinks">ShowDirSymlinks</link>"
	    config setting)
	    You can also make use of environment variables like $HOME here,
	    an example for using a mywinedrive directory in your home dir
	    would be
	    "Path" = "${HOME}/mywinedrive"
	    Don't forget to leave off the trailing slash!
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Type" = "hd|cdrom|network|floppy"</programlisting>
            Sets up the type of drive Wine will see it as. Type must
            equal one of the four <literal>floppy</literal>,
            <literal>hd</literal>, <literal>cdrom</literal>, or
            <literal>network</literal>. They are self-explanatory.
            (The |'s mean "Type = '&lt;one of the options&gt;'".)
	    Usually, you choose "hd" for a drive ("hd" is default anyway).
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Label" = "blah"</programlisting>
	    Defines the drive label. Generally only needed
	    for programs that look for a special CD-ROM.
            The label may be up to 11 characters.
	    Note that the preferred way of managing labels and serial numbers
	    of CD-ROMs and floppies is to give Wine raw device access for
	    reading these on a per-CD case (see "Device" below) instead of
	    hardcoding one specific "Label".
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Serial" = "deadbeef"</programlisting>
            Tells Wine the serial number of the drive. A few programs with
            intense protection for pirating might need this, but otherwise
            it's not needed. Up to 8 characters and hexadecimal.
	    Using a "Device" entry instead of hardcoding the "Serial" probably
	    is a smarter choice.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Filesystem" = "win95|unix|msdos"</programlisting>
            Sets up the way Wine looks at files on the drive.
          </para>

          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term><literal>win95</literal></term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  Case insensitive. Alike to Windows 9x/NT 4. This is
                  the long filename filesystem you are probably used
                  to working with. The filesystem of choice for most
                  applications to be run under wine.  PROBABLY THE ONE
                  YOU WANT!
                </para>

              <term><literal>unix</literal></term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  Case sensitive. This filesystem has almost no use
                  (Windows apps expect case insensitive filenames).
                  Try it if you dare, but win95 is a  much better
                  choice.
                </para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
              <term><literal>msdos</literal></term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  Case insensitive filesystem. Alike to DOS and
                  Windows 3.x. <literal>8.3</literal> is the maximum
                  length of files (eightdot.123) - longer ones will be
                  truncated. (NOTE: this is a very bad choice if you
                  plan on running apps that use long filenames. win95
                  should work fine with apps that were designed to run
                  under the msdos system. In other words, you might
                  not want to use this.)
                </para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
          </variablelist>

          <programlisting>"Device" = "/dev/xx"</programlisting>
          <para>
	    Needed for raw device access and label and serial number reading.
            Use this ONLY for floppy and cdrom devices. Using it on
            Extended2 or other Unix file systems can have dire results
	    (when a windows app tries to do a lowlevel write,
	    they do it in a FAT way -- FAT format is completely different from
	    any Unix file system).
	    Also, make sure that you have proper permissions to this device
	    file.
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              This setting is not really important; almost all apps
              will have no problem if it remains unspecified. For
              CD-ROMs it's quite useful in order to get automatic label
              detection, though. If you are unsure about specifying
              device names, just leave out this setting for your
              drives.

	    Here are a few sample entries:

"Path" = "/dosc"
"Type" = "hd"
"Label" = "Hard Drive"
"Filesystem" = "win95"
This is a setup for Drive E, a generic CD-ROM drive:

        <sect3 id="config-wine">
          <title>The [wine] Section </title>
          <para>
            The [wine] section of the configuration file contains all kinds
            of general settings for Wine.
	  </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Windows" = "c:\\windows"</programlisting>
            This tells Wine and Windows programs where the
            <filename>Windows</filename> directory is.  It is
            recommended to have this directory somewhere on your
            configured <medialabel>C</medialabel> drive, and it's also
            recommended to just call the directory "windows" (this is
            the default setup on Windows, and some stupid applications
            might rely on this).  So in case you chose a "Windows"
            setting of "c:\\windows" and you chose to set up a drive C
            e.g. at <filename>/usr/local/wine_c</filename>, the
            corresponding directory would be
            <filename>/usr/local/wine_c/windows</filename>.  Make one
            if you don't already have one. NO TRAILING SLASH (NOT
            <filename>C:\\windows\</filename>)! Write access strongly
            recommended!
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"System" = "c:\\windows\\system"</programlisting>
            This sets up where the windows system files are. The Windows
	    system directory should reside below the directory used for the
            <literal>Windows</literal> setting.
	    Thus when using the example above, the system directory would be
	    <filename>/usr/local/wine_c/windows/system</filename>.
            Again, no trailing slash, and write access!
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Temp" = "c:\\temp"</programlisting> This should
            be the directory you want your temp files stored in,
	    /usr/local/wine_c/temp in our example.
            Again, no trailing slash, and WRITE ACCESS!!
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>
"Path" = "c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system;c:\\blanco"
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Behaves like the <envar>PATH</envar> setting on UNIX
            boxes. When wine is run like <userinput>wine
              sol.exe</userinput>, if <filename>sol.exe</filename>
            resides in a directory specified in the
            <literal>Path</literal> setting, wine will run it (Of
            course, if <filename>sol.exe</filename> resides in the
            current directory, wine will run that one). Make sure it
            always has your <filename>windows</filename> directory and
            system directory (For this setup, it must have
            <filename>"c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system"</filename>).
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"GraphicsDriver" = "x11drv|ttydrv"</programlisting>
	    Sets the graphics driver to use for Wine output.
	    x11drv is for X11 output, ttydrv is for text console output.
	    WARNING: if you use ttydrv here, then you won't be able to run
	    any Windows GUI programs. Thus this option is mainly interesting
	    for e.g. embedded use of Wine in web server scripts.
	    Note that ttydrv is still very lacking, so if it doesn't work,
	    resort to using "xvfb", a virtual X11 server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            <programlisting>"Printer" = "off|on"</programlisting> Tells wine
            whether to allow printing via printer drivers to work.
	    This option isn't needed for our builtin psdrv printer driver
	    at all.
            Using these things are pretty alpha, so you might want to
            watch out. Some people might find it useful, however. If
            you're not planning to work on printing via windows printer
	    drivers, don't even add this to your wine config file
	    (It probably isn't already in it).
	    Check out the [spooler] and [parallelports] sections too.

	    <programlisting>"ShellLinker" = "wineshelllink"</programlisting>
	    This setting specifies the shell linker script to use for setting
	    up Windows icons in e.g. KDE or Gnome that are given by programs
	    making use of appropriate shell32.dll functionality to create
	    icons on the desktop/start menu during installation.

	  <para id="dirsymlinks">
	    <programlisting>"ShowDirSymlinks" = "1"</programlisting>
	    Wine doesn't pass directory symlinks to Windows programs by
	    default, as doing so may crash some programs that do
	    recursive lookups of whole subdirectory trees
	    whenever a directory symlink points back to itself or one of its
	    parent directories.
	    That's why we disallowed the use of directory symlinks
	    and added this setting to reenable ("1") this functionality.

            Sets up the symbol table file for the wine debugger. You
            probably don't need to fiddle with this. May be useful if
            your wine is stripped.

            <para>
              Most windows DLL's have a win16 (Windows 3.x) and win32
              (Windows 9x/NT) form.  The combination of the win16 and
              win32 DLL versions are called the "DLL pair". This is a
              list of the most common pairs:

            <para>
              There are a few different forms of DLL's wine can load:

                      The DLL's that are included with windows. Many
                      windows DLL's can be loaded in their native
                      form. Many times these native versions work
                      better than their non-Microsoft equivalent --
                      other times they don't.

                      The most common form of DLL loading. This is
                      what you will use if the DLL is to system-specific
		      or error-prone in native form (KERNEL for example),
		      you don't have the native DLL, or you just want to be
                      Microsoft-free.

            This setting is a comma-delimited list of the order in

          <title>The [DllPairs] Section</title>
          <para>
          At one time, there was a section called [DllPairs] in the
          default configuration file, but this has been obsoleted
          because the pairing information has now been embedded into
          Wine itself. (The purpose of this section was merely to be
          able to issue warnings if the user attempted to pair
          codependent 16-bit/32-bit DLLs of different types.) If you
          still have this in your <filename>~/.wine/.config</filename> or
          <filename>wine.conf</filename>, you may safely delete it.

          <para>
            For example, to load builtin KERNEL pair (case doesn't
            matter here):
            <programlisting>
"kernel,kernel32" = "builtin"
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            To load the native COMMDLG pair, but if that doesn't work
            try builtin:
            <programlisting>
"commdlg,comdlg32" = "native,builtin"
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>

          <title>The [fonts] Section</title>
          <para>
            This section sets up wine's font handling.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Resolution" = "96"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Since the way X handles fonts is different from the way
            Windows does, wine uses a special mechanism to deal with
            them. It must scale them using the number defined in the
            "Resolution" setting. 60-120 are reasonable values, 96 is
            a nice in the middle one. If you have the real windows
            fonts available (<filename>&lt;dirs to
              wine>/documentation/ttfserver</filename> and
            <filename>fonts</filename>), this parameter will not be as
            important. Of course, it's always good to get your X fonts
            working acceptably in wine.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Default" = "-adobe-times-"</programlisting>
            The default font wine uses. Fool around with it if you'd like.
          </para>
          <para>
OPTIONAL:
          </para>
          <para>
            The <literal>Alias</literal> setting allows you to map an X font to a font
            used in wine. This is good for apps that need a special font you don't have,
            but a good replacement exists. The syntax is like so:
            <programlisting>
"AliasX" = "[Fake windows name],[Real X name]"&lt;,optional "masking" section>
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Pretty straightforward. Replace "AliasX" with "Alias0",
            then "Alias1" and so on. The fake windows name is the name
            that the font will be under a windows app in wine. The
            real X name is the font name as seen by X (Run
            "xfontsel"). The optional "masking" section allows you to
            utilize the fake windows name you define. If it is not
            used, then wine will just try to extract the fake windows
            name itself and not use the value you enter.
          </para>
          <para>
            Here is an example of an alias without masking. The font will show up in windows
            apps as "Google".

            <programlisting>
"Alias0" = "Foo,--google-"
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Here is an example with masking enabled. The font will show up as "Foo" in
            windows apps.
            <programlisting>
"Alias1" = "Foo,--google-,subst"
            </programlisting>
          </para>

        <sect3>
          <title>The [serialports], [parallelports], [spooler], and [ports] Sections</title>
          <para>
            Even though it sounds like a lot of sections, these are
            all closely related. They are all for communications and
            parallel ports.
          </para>
          <para>
            The [serialports] section tells wine what serial ports it
            is allowed to use.
            <programlisting>"ComX" = "/dev/ttySY"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Replace <literal>X</literal> with the number of the COM
            port in Windows (1-8) and <literal>Y</literal> with the
            number of it in <literal>X</literal> (Usually the number
            of the port in Windows minus 1). <literal>ComX</literal>
            can actually equal any device
            (<medialabel>/dev/modem</medialabel> is acceptable). It is
            not always necessary to define any COM ports (An optional
            setting). Here is an example:
            <programlisting>"Com1" = "/dev/ttyS0"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Use as many of these as you like in the section to define
            all of the COM ports you need.
          </para>
          <para>
            The [parallelports] section sets up any parallel ports
            that will be allowed access under wine.
            <programlisting>"LptX" = "/dev/lpY"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Sounds familiar? Syntax is just like the COM port setting.
            Replace <literal>X</literal> with a value from 1-4 as it
            is in Windows and <literal>Y</literal> with a value from
            0-3 (<literal>Y</literal> is usually the value in windows
            minus 1, just like for COM ports). You don't always need
            to define a parallel port (AKA, it's optional). As with
            the other section, LptX can equal any device (Maybe
            <medialabel>/dev/printer</medialabel>). Here is an
            example:  <programlisting>"Lpt1" = "/dev/lp0"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            The [spooler] section will inform wine where to spool
            print jobs. Use this if you want to try printing. Wine
            docs claim that spooling is "rather primitive" at this
            time, so it won't work perfectly. IT IS OPTIONAL. The only
            setting you use in this section works to map a port (LPT1,
            for example) to a file or a command. Here is an example,
            mapping LPT1 to the file <filename>out.ps</filename>:
            <programlisting>"LPT1:" = "out.ps"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            The following command maps printing jobs to LPT1 to the
            command <command>lpr</command>. Notice  the |:
            <programlisting>"LPT1:" = "|lpr"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            The [ports] section is usually useful only for people who
            need direct port access for programs requiring dongles or
            scanners. IF YOU DON'T NEED IT, DON'T USE IT!
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"read" = "0x779,0x379,0x280-0x2a0"</programlisting>
            Gives direct read access to those IO's.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"write" = "0x779,0x379,0x280-0x2a0"</programlisting>
            Gives direct write access to those IO's. It's probably a
            good idea to keep the values of the

                  A boolean setting (default: <literal>Y</literal>) 
                  that affects the way Wine sets the computer name. The computer
                  name in the Windows world is the so-called <emphasis>NetBIOS name</emphasis>.
                  It is contained in the <varname>ComputerName</varname> in the registry entry
                  <varname>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName</varname>.

                <para>
                  If this option is set to "Y" or missing, Wine will set the
                  NetBIOS name to the Unix host name of your computer, if 
                  necessary truncated to 31 characters. The Unix hostname is the output
                  of the shell command <command>hostname</command>, up to but not
                  including the first dot ('.'). Among other things, this means that
                  Windows programs running under Wine cannot change the NetBIOS computer name.
                </para>
                <para>
                  If this option is set to "N", Wine will use the registry value above
                  to set the NetBIOS name. Only if the registry entry doesn't exist (usually
                  only during the first wine startup) it will use the Unix hostname as
                  usual. Windows applications can change the NetBIOS name. The change
                  will be effective after a "reboot", i.e. after restarting Wine.

      <title>Configuring the x11drv Driver</title>

      </para>
      <para>
        (Extracted from <filename>wine/documentation/x11drv</filename>)
      </para>

      <para>
        Most Wine users run Wine under the windowing system known as
        X11. During most of Wine's history, this was the only display
        driver available, but in recent years, parts of Wine have been
        reorganized to allow for other display drivers (although the
        only alternative currently available is Patrik Stridvall's
        ncurses-based ttydrv, which he claims works for displaying
        calc.exe). The display driver is chosen with the
        <literal>GraphicsDriver</literal> option in the [wine] section
        of <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>, but I will only cover the
        x11drv driver in this article.
      </para>

      <sect2>
        <title>x11drv modes of operation</title>

        <para>
          The x11drv driver consists of two conceptually distinct
          pieces, the graphics driver (GDI part), and the windowing
          driver (USER part). Both of these are linked into the
          <filename>libx11drv.so</filename> module, though (which you
          load with the <literal>GraphicsDriver</literal> option). In
          Wine, running on X11, the graphics driver must draw on
          drawables (window interiors) provided by the windowing
          driver. This differs a bit from the Windows model, where the
          windowing system creates and configures device contexts
          controlled by the graphics driver, and applications are
          allowed to hook into this relationship anywhere they like.
          Thus, to provide any reasonable tradeoff between
          compatibility and usability, the x11drv has three different
          modes of operation.

                better with the rest of your desktop, but may not
                always work perfectly (a rewrite of this mode of
                operation, to make it more robust and less patchy, is
                currently being done, though, and it's planned to be
                finished before the Wine 1.0 release).

                decorations (title bars, borders, etc) are drawn by
                Wine to look and feel like the real Windows. This is
                compatible with applications that depend on being able
                to compute the exact sizes of any such decorations, or
                that want to draw their own.
                Unmanaged mode is only used if both Managed and Desktop

                compatible with the Windows model. All application
                windows will just be Wine-drawn windows inside the
                Wine-provided desktop window (which will itself be
                managed by your window manager), and Windows
                applications can roam freely within this virtual
                workspace and think they own it all, without
                disturbing your other X apps.

                take over the entire display and run the game
                full-screen at maximum speed. (With DGA1 (XFree86
                3.x), you still have to configure the X server to the
                game's requested bpp first, but with DGA2 (XFree86
                4.x), runtime depth-switching may be possible,
                depending on your driver's capabilities.) But be aware
                that if Wine crashes while in DGA mode, it may not be
                possible to regain control over your computer without

                If you don't want DirectX to use DGA, you can at least
                use X Shared Memory extensions (XShm). It is much
                slower than DGA, since the app doesn't have direct
                access to the physical frame buffer, but using shared
                memory to draw the frame is at least faster than
                sending the data through the standard X11 socket, even
                though Wine's XShm support is still known to crash
                sometimes.

      <title>Setting the windows and DOS version value that's passed to

      <para>
        The windows and DOS version value a program gets e.g. by calling the
	Windows function GetVersion() plays a very important role:
	If your Wine installation for whatever reason fails to provide
	to your program the correct version value that it expects,
	then the program might assume some very bad things and fail (in
	the worst case even silently !).
    
        Fortunately Wine contains some more or less intelligent Windows
	version guessing algorithm that will try to guess the Windows
	version a program might expect and pass that one on to the
	program.

	Thus you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> lightly configure a version value, as this will be a "forced" value and thus turn out to be rather harmful to proper operation. In other words: only explicitly set a Windows version value in case Wine's own version detection was unable to provide the correct Windows version and the program fails.

        Until now, your only possibility of specifying drive volume
        labels and serial numbers was to set them manually in the wine
        config file. By now, wine can read them directly from the
        device as well. This may be useful for many Win 9x games or
        for setup programs distributed on CD-ROMs that check for
        volume label.

          Reading labels and serial numbers just works automagically
          if you specify a <literal>Device=</literal> line in the
          [Drive X] section in your <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>.
          Note that the device has to exist and must be accessible if
          you do this, though.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you don't do that, then you should give fixed
          <literal>"Label" =</literal> or <literal>"Serial" =</literal>
          entries in <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>, as Wine returns
          these entries instead if no device is given. If they don't
          exist, then Wine will return default values (label
          <literal>Drive X</literal> and serial
          <literal>12345678</literal>).

	  a <emphasis>fixed</emphasis>, preconfigured label), you need
          to specify <literal>"ReadVolInfo" = "0"</literal> to tell Wine
          to skip the volume reading.

          The wine config file directives [DllDefaults]
          and [DllOverrides] are the subject of some confusion. The
          overall purpose of most of these directives are clear enough,
          though - given a choice, should Wine use its own built-in
          DLLs, or should it use <filename>.DLL</filename> files found
          in an existing Windows installation? This document explains
          how this feature works.

            At one time, there was a section called [DllPairs] in the
            default configuration file, but this has been obsoleted
            because the pairing information has now been embedded into
            Wine itself. (The purpose of this section was merely to be
            able to issue warnings if the user attempted to pair
            codependent 16-bit/32-bit DLLs of different types.) If you
            still have this in your <filename>~/.wine/config</filename> or
            <filename>wine.conf</filename>, you may safely delete it.

            or not, if you have some from a real Windows configuration.
            Because builtins do not mix seamlessly with native DLLs yet,
            certain DLL dependencies may be problematic, but workarounds
            exist in Wine for many popular DLL configurations. Also see
            WWN's [16]Status Page to figure out how well your favorite
            DLL is implemented in Wine.

        <para>
	  In case Wine complains about a missing DLL, you should check whether
	  this file is a publicly available DLL or a custom DLL belonging
	  to your program (by searching for its name on the internet).
	  If you managed to get hold of the DLL, then you should make sure
	  that Wine is able to find and load it.
	  DLLs usually get loaded according to the mechanism of the
	  SearchPath() function.
	  This function searches directories in the following order:

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
	        The directory the program was started from.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
	        The current directory.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
	        The Windows system directory.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
	        The Windows directory.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
	        The PATH variable directories.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

	  In short: either put the required DLL into your application
	  directory (might be ugly), or usually put it into the Windows system
	  directory. Just find out its directory by having a look at the Wine
	  config File variable "System" (which indicates the location of the
	  Windows system directory) and the associated drive entry.
	  Note that you probably shouldn't use NT-based native DLLs,
	  since Wine's NT API support is somewhat weaker than its Win9x
	  API support (thus leading to even worse compatibility with NT DLLs
	  than with a no-windows setup !), so better use Win9x native DLLs
	  instead or no native DLLs at all.

      <para>
        Wine now needs to know about your keyboard layout. This
        requirement comes from a need from many apps to have the
        correct scancodes available, since they read these directly,
        instead of just taking the characters returned by the X
        server. This means that Wine now needs to have a mapping from
        X keys to the scancodes these applications expect.
      </para>
      <para>
        On startup, Wine will try to recognize the active X layout by
        seeing if it matches any of the defined tables. If it does,
        everything is alright. If not, you need to define it.
      </para>
      <para>
        To do this, open the file
        <filename>dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c</filename> and take a look
        at the existing tables. Make a backup copy of it, especially
        if you don't use CVS.
      </para>
      <para>
        What you really would need to do, is find out which scancode
        each key needs to generate.  Find it in the
        <function>main_key_scan</function> table, which looks like
        this:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
static const int main_key_scan[MAIN_LEN] =
{
/* this is my (102-key) keyboard layout, sorry if it doesn't quite match yours */
   0x29,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08,0x09,0x0A,0x0B,0x0C,0x0D,
   0x10,0x11,0x12,0x13,0x14,0x15,0x16,0x17,0x18,0x19,0x1A,0x1B,
   0x1E,0x1F,0x20,0x21,0x22,0x23,0x24,0x25,0x26,0x27,0x28,0x2B,
   0x2C,0x2D,0x2E,0x2F,0x30,0x31,0x32,0x33,0x34,0x35,
   0x56 /* the 102nd key (actually to the right of l-shift) */
};
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Next, assign each scancode the characters imprinted on the
        keycaps. This was done (sort of) for the US 101-key keyboard,
        which you can find near the top in
        <filename>keyboard.c</filename>. It also shows that if there
        is no 102nd key, you can skip that.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, for most international 102-key keyboards, we have
        done it easy for you. The scancode layout for these already
        pretty much matches the physical layout in the
        <function>main_key_scan</function>, so all you need to do is
        to go through all the keys that generate characters on your
        main keyboard (except spacebar), and stuff those into an
        appropriate table. The only exception is that the 102nd key,
        which is usually to the left of the first key of the last line
        (usually <keycap>Z</keycap>), must be placed on a separate
        line after the last line.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, my Norwegian keyboard looks like this
      </para>
      <screen>
  !  "  #    %  &  /  (  )  =  ?  `  Back-
|  1  2@ 3 4$ 5  6  7{ 8[ 9] 0} +  \ space

                                     ~
                                        Enter
Caps A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L      *

Sh- > Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  ;  :  _  Shift
ift &lt;                      ,  .  -

Ctrl  Alt       Spacebar       AltGr  Ctrl
      </screen>
      <para>
        Note the 102nd key, which is the <keycap>&lt;></keycap> key, to
        the left of <keycap>Z</keycap>. The character to the right of
        the main character is the character generated by
        <keycap>AltGr</keycap>.
      </para>
      <para>
        This keyboard is defined as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
static const char main_key_NO[MAIN_LEN][4] =
{
 "|","1!","2\"@","3#","4$","5%","6&","7/{","8([","9)]","0=}","+?","\\",
 "qQ","wW","eE","rR","tT","yY","uU","iI","oO","pP","","^~",
 "aA","sS","dD","fF","gG","hH","jJ","kK","lL","","","'*",
 "zZ","xX","cC","vV","bB","nN","mM",",;",".:","-_",
 "&lt;>"
};
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Except that " and \ needs to be quoted with a backslash, and
        that the 102nd key is on a separate line, it's pretty
        straightforward.
      </para>
      <para>
        After you have written such a table, you need to add it to the
        <function>main_key_tab[]</function> layout index table. This
        will look like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
static struct {
 WORD lang, ansi_codepage, oem_codepage;
 const char (*key)[MAIN_LEN][4];
} main_key_tab[]={
...
...
 {MAKELANGID(LANG_NORWEGIAN,SUBLANG_DEFAULT),  1252, 865, &amp;main_key_NO},
...
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        After you have added your table, recompile Wine and test that
        it works. If it fails to detect your table, try running
      </para>
      <screen>
wine --debugmsg +key,+keyboard >& key.log
      </screen>
      <para>
        and look in the resulting <filename>key.log</filename> file to
        find the error messages it gives for your layout.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that the <constant>LANG_*</constant> and
        <constant>SUBLANG_*</constant> definitions are in
        <filename>include/winnls.h</filename>, which you might need to
        know to find out which numbers your language is assigned, and
        find it in the debugmsg output. The numbers will be
        <literal>(SUBLANG * 0x400 + LANG)</literal>, so, for example
        the combination <literal>LANG_NORWEGIAN (0x14)</literal> and
        <literal>SUBLANG_DEFAULT (0x1)</literal> will be (in hex)
        <literal>14 + 1*400 = 414</literal>, so since I'm Norwegian, I
        could look for <literal>0414</literal> in the debugmsg output
        to find out why my keyboard won't detect.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once it works, submit it to the Wine project. If you use CVS,
        you will just have to do
      </para>
      <screen>
cvs -z3 diff -u dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c > layout.diff
      </screen>
      <para>
        from your main Wine directory, then submit
        <filename>layout.diff</filename> to
        <email>wine-patches@winehq.com</email> along with a brief note
        of what it is.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you don't use CVS, you need to do
      </para>
      <screen>
diff -u the_backup_file_you_made dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c > layout.diff
      </screen>
      <para>
        and submit it as explained above.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you did it right, it will be included in the next Wine
        release, and all the troublesome applications (especially
        remote-control applications) and games that use scancodes will
        be happily using your keyboard layout, and you won't get those
        annoying fixme messages either.
      </para>
      <para>
        Good luck.

      <title>Using ODBC</title>
      <para>
        This section describes how ODBC works within Wine and how to configure
        it to do what you want (if it can do what you want).
      </para>
      <para>
        The ODBC system within wine, as with the printing system, is designed
        to hook across to the Unix system at a high level.  Rather than 
        ensuring that all the windows code works under wine it uses a suitable
        Unix ODBC provider, such as UnixODBC.  Thus if you configure Wine to 
        use the builtin odbc32.dll that wine dll will interface to your 
        Unix ODBC package and let that do the work, whereas if you configure 
        Wine to use the native odbc32.dll it will try to use the native
        ODBC32 drivers etc.
      </para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Using a Unix ODBC system with Wine</title>
        <para>
          The first step in using a Unix ODBC system with Wine is, of course,
          to get the Unix ODBC system working itself.  This may involve 
          downloading code or rpms etc.  There are several Unix ODBC systems
          available; the one the author is used to is unixODBC (with the
          IBM DB2 driver). Typically such systems will include a tool, such 
          as isql, which will allow you to access the data from the command
          line so that you can check that the system is working.
        </para>
        <para>
          The next step is to hook the Unix ODBC library to the wine builtin 
          odbc32 dll.  The builtin odbc32 (currently) looks to the
          environmental variable <emphasis>LIB_ODBC_DRIVER_MANAGER</emphasis>
          for the name of the odbc library.  For example in the author's
          .bashrc file is the line:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
export LIB_ODBC_DRIVER_MANAGER=/usr/lib/libodbc.so.1.0.0
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          If that environmental variable is not set then it looks for a 
          library called libodbc.so and so you can add a symbolic link to
          equate that to your own library.  For example as root you could
          run the commands:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
ln -s libodbc.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib/libodbc.so
/sbin/ldconfig
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          The last step in configuring this is to ensure that Wine is set up
          to run the builtin version of odbc32.dll, by modifying the DLL
          configuration.  This builtin dll merely acts as a stub between the
          calling code and the Unix ODBC library.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you have any problems then you can use the debugmsg channel
          odbc32 to trace what is happening.  One word of warning.  Some
          programs actually cheat a little and bypass the odbc library.  For
          example the Crystal Reports engine goes to the registry to check on
          the DSN.  The fix for this is documented at unixODBC's site where 
          there is a section on using unixODBC with Wine.
