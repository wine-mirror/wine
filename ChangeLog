	bitmaps which don't end 0x00, 0x02 (previously it blew up).  This
	includes some bitmaps output by Paint Shop Pro.  Implementation is
	possibly now too lax.  Please see the notes on the function about
	why.

	* [controls/desktop.c]
	The desktop pattern should be painted if the wallpaper doesn't

	concerning DLLs off.

	* [controls/combo.c]
	Added some handling for combo controls with ownerdraw-styles

	* [Configure]
	Rewrote much of it.  Added capability to generate a wine.ini
	file.  Commented out the processor emulator options until that

	that it breaks under *BSD.

	* [misc/dos_fs.c]
	Removed/changed calls to ToUnix() (which calls tolower()) so
	that the part of the pathname which correspond with the drive
	letter on DOS no longer will be mapped to lowercase.  This
	means that it should be possible to have uppercase letters in
	the [drives] section of wine.ini.

        * controls/button.c ( [CR]B_LButton* ) 
        left rc.right at full window width so click on label also 
        activates the control (MSWin behavior)

Sat Jun 11 19:05:40 1994  Olaf Flebbe  (flebbe@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de)

        * include/windows.h:
          functions pointers can not be packed.
          (annoying warnings with forthcomming gcc-2.6.x)
        
        * loader/main.c (InitDLL): 
          Fixed a printf statement. (for control.exe)

          added missing breaks; (PENSATE starts) 

        * windows/graphics.c (FloodFill):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 08:41:27 1994  Bob Amstadt  (bob@pooh)

	* loader/selector.c (FixupFunctionPrologs): 
	New function to fixup loaded DLL function prologs.  It replaces the
	do nothing code with code that loads DS with the appropriate data
	segment for the DLL.

	* misc/cursor.c (LoadCursor): 
	Disabled cursor loading from .EXE or .DLL.  The code needs to handle
	the possibility of multiple cursors in a single directory.  Also,
	it should check to see if the cursor is the right size.

	* objects/font.c (EnumFonts): 
	Checked for lpLogFontList[i] == NULL

	* objects/gdiobj.c (SetObjectOwner): 
	Removed stub.  Replaced with simple return in gdi.spec.  This
	function is not defined for the retail version of Windows.

	* memory/heap.c (WIN16_LocalHandleDelta): 
	New function.  This is really a dummy that imitates the proper
	return values.

	* loader/library.c (GetProcAddress): 
	Fixed definition of IS_BUILTIN_DLL() macro.

Mon Jun  6 18:15:40 1994  Bob Amstadt  (bob@pooh)

	* windows/utility.c (windows_wsprintf): 
	Added support for '#' in format, and fixed bug with "ptr" being
	incremented too many times.

	* miscemu/int21.c (OpenExistingFile): 
	Add code to handle opening files read-only and write-only.

	* loader/wine.c:
	Segment fixups now done in LoadImage instead of _WinMain.  This
	is necessary to support LoadLibrary().

Sun Jun  5 17:34:24 1994  Erik Bos (erik@hacktic.nl)

	* [loader/*]
		- fixed: GetModuleHandle() sometimes returned
		  a wrong handle.
		- don't init dlls when cs == 0 (lzexpand, doesn't
		  seem to have a init function)
		- LoadLibrary & LoadImage now return error instead
		  of stopping wine.
		- moved most of NE-functions into one file.
		- LoadLibrary() uses w_files list instead of its
		  own list.
		- NE exectables are now fixed-up and initialised when
		  loaded instead of only once before calling InitTask.

	* [miscemu/int15.c] [miscemu/int31.c]
	Added.	

	* [loader/selector.c]
	Stubs added for {Get|Set}SelectorLimit(), {Get|Set}SelectorBase().

	Stub added for IsRomModule().

	* [miscemu/int21.c]
	Some cleanup, added heap for returning data.

Jun 6, 94 martin2@trgcorp.solucorp.qc.ca (Martin Ayotte)

	* [tools/build.c]
	Change MAX_ORDINALS	define to higher value, 1299 entries.
	(MMSYSTEM doesn't have succesive numbers, some are around 1200).

	* [windows/utility.c]
	Bug fix in windows_wsprintf(), (twice increments ...).

	* [windows/winpos.c]
	Bug fix in SetWindowPos(), redraw was done if flag
		was set to SWP_NOREDRAW while SWP_SHOWWINDOW).

	* [misc/message.c] [controls/combo.c]
	Add an InvalidateRect() in WM_SHOWWINDOW to statisfy the new 'saveunder'.

	* [windows/win.c]
	In CreateWindowEx(), do SetMenu() calls after window creation,
		just before sending to WM_NCCALCSIZE.

	* [controls/menu.c]
	In function SetMenu(), now use SetWindowPos() with 
		flags SWP_FRAMECHANGED to readjust menu area.
	Function MenuBarCalcSize() redone.

Sun May 29 11:08:24 1994  David B. Thomas  (dt@yenta.abq.nm.us)

        * [objects/text.c]
        Fixed problems associated with DT_WORDBREAK flag.  String length
        was not being properly decremented when lines were folded, and
        wrapping was not performed when DT_NOCLIP and DT_NOPREFIX were
        both on in addition to DT_WORDBREAK.  Windows does wrapping in
        this case, and now so does wine.

Sun Jun  5 19:17:49 1994  Olaf Flebbe  (olaf@dragon)

        * [edit.c]
        cp1 was uninitialized iff lineno == 0

        *  FindFile tests for existance of file even if a full
           filename was supplied. What about unix file names?

        * [controls/listbox ]
        wndPtr was uninitialized for LB_SETTOPINDEX

        * [misc/property.c]     
        Do not free lpProp. Is it really allocated by malloc?
	{edited by Bob Amstadt: changed free() to GlobalFree()}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 28 12:03:23 1994  Bob Amstadt  (bob@pooh)

	* miscemu/int21.c (OpenExistingFile): 
	OpenExistingFile needed to return handle in AX register instead
	of the BX register.

	* miscemu/int21.c (ioctlGetDeviceInfo): 
	Added a little code to give a fake result for normal files.

Wed May 25 21:55:38 1994  Bob Amstadt  (bob@pooh)

	* [memory/global.c]
	return value from GlobalSize was completely wrong.

	* [miscemu/int21.h]
	fixed bug in FindFirst.  Directory pointer (dp) was not placed in
	dta correctly.

	* [tools/build.c]
	fixed creation of pop.h to guarantee that flags are restored correctly.

	* [misc/comm.c]
	changed all occurance of strncmp() to strncasecmp().
	BuildCommDCB() should not require that OpenComm() be called first.

	* [loader/selector.c]
	Heap initialized to size of full segment less stack size and 
	automatic data size.

Sat May 28 09:14:33 1994  Rick Sladkey  (jrs@world.std.com)

	* [controls/listbox.c]
	Correct typos in ListBoxResetContent where lpls variable is
	used where lsls2 variable is meant.  Don't call USER_HEAP_FREE
	twice on the same handle if hData and hMem are the same.

	* [debugger/opcodes/i386-dis.c]
	Add new name array names_rmw for table driven decoding of the
	16-bit mod/rm field.  Omit large case statement in OP_E and
	replace with array reference to match existing coding style.
	Add new static variable machine with value 286 or 386 to
	correctly decode mod/rm field in either 16 or 32 bit modes.
	Set it in print_insn_i{2,3}86.  In OP_E use it to decide how
	to decode mod/rm.  While the code was correct for 16 bit code,
	it was improperly decoding mod/rm fields on word prefixed
	32 bit instructions.

	* [debugger/debug.l]
	Recognize new token ABORT.   Recognize single letters 'p'
	and 'q' as tokens.

	* [debugger/dbg.y]
	Add new token ABORT.  Allow print command to be invoked by
	'p' and quit command by 'q', ala GDB.  Change lots of '};'
	to just '}'.  Add static dummy_regs to wine_debug so that
	wine_debug(0, NULL) doesn't core dump with qmagic.

	* [debugger/info.c]
	Correct syntax of break command in helptext and omit former
	comment about probable bugginess of the disassembly since it
	is now correct.  Change fprintf of first backtrace stack
	frame to match that of the second and subsequent frames.

	* [loader/selector.c]
	Change construction of command line in CreatePSP from creating
	a string that looks like "arg1 arg2 \r" to "arg1 arg2".  A DOS
	PSP command line looks like " arg1 arg2\r" with the length not
	including the trailing "\r" but that is not how Windows does it.

	* [loader/library.c]
	Change uses of %s to print strings in GetModuleHandle to %x so
	that string IDs don't cause a core dump with qmagic.  Handle
	converting a string id to a literal module handle.  For
	example, GetModuleHandle((LPSTR) 0x57) now returns 0x57 if
	it is a real module handle.

	* [misc/message.c]
	In MessageBox, translate a NULL title argument to the string "Error".

	* [misc/profile.c]
	In GetSetProfile translate a NULL Default argument to "".  Any
	caller whose Default argument is NULL is buggy, but CHARMAP does it
	anyway.

	* [objects/font.c]
	Add NULL pointer checks in EnumFontFamilies to prevent core dumps.

Sat May 28 20:01:51 1994 Jon Tombs (jon@gtex02.us.es) 

	* New options/resourses nosaveunders and nobackingstore.  By 
	default backingstore and saveunders are now enabled, these use 
	more memory but avoids those slow (sometimes multiple) redraws 
	caused be exposure events.

May 30, 94 martin2@trgcorp.solucorp.qc.ca (Martin Ayotte)

	* [misc/driver.c] New file
	Skeleton for 'Installable Wine Drivers' functions. :-)

	Bug fix in GetSetProfile(), bad enumeration if KeyName == NULL.

	* [objects/gdi.c]
	New function CreateDiscardableBitmap(), it just calling 
	CreateCompatibleBitmap() for now. It's get 'clock.exe' running ! :-)

	* [controls/listbox.c]
	* [controls/combo.c]
	New font member assigned to SYSTEM_FONT as default.
	Added processing for WM_SETFONT message;

        * [miscemu/int21.c]
        Fix NULL dereference caused by superfluous DOS_closedir in FindNext.

        * [loader/resource.c]
        New function type_match to handle string resource types as
        well as IDs.  In addition, compare only low 4 bits of type_id
        when both numbers are IDs so that 0x0002 matches 0x8002.
        In FindResourceByNumber and FindResourceByName use type_match
        instead of comparing numbers.  In FindResource handle the
        "#number" syntax and empty strings in both the resource and
        type names.

Mon May 23 00:48:25 1994  Rick Sladkey  (jrs@world.std.com)

	* [include/winsock.h]
	The sockproto struct is already defined in <sys/socket.h>

	* [misc/winsock.c]
	Need to include <netinet/in.h> for struct in-addr.
	Use sys_errlist[] instead of strerror[].

	*[toolkit/heap.c]
	ANSI C specifies that the malloc functions are defined in stdlib.h,
	  so we don't need to include malloc.h.

	*[loader/ldtlib.c]
	Print informative error message about probable cause of i386_set_ldt()
	  failure and then exit.

	*[Imakefile]
	For systems that don't use gmake by default, set the MAKE variable
	  to gmake and propagate it on recursive makes.
	Take out -li386 for FreeBSD systems and define __FreeBSD__ so Wine
	  can be built with the FreeBSD 1.0.2 compiler.

        * [windows/graphics.c]
        Added FloodFill and FloodFill_rec.  FloodFill_rec is pretty
        inefficent, but should suffice for now.

        * [include/windows.h]
        Changed the x,y paramaters for the FloodFill prototype 
        from ints to shorts

	load_name_info functions.

	* [toolkit/heap.c] 
	Code cleanup. 

	* [misc/user.c]

	functions in the ~loader subdirectory in the future. CUrrently is
	needed since it has USER_InitApp.

	* [misc/resource.c]
	Since WineLib will probably need DLLs (currently it needs
	Sysres.dll). WineLib will be using much code of the loader again.
	So I removed some ifdefs that were used by WineLib.

	Added load_typeinfo and load_nameinfo (and the corresponding
	functions in [toolkit/sup.c]

	Added integer convertion functions in the needed places.

	Added very ugly patch (includes wine.c). In the next release I
	plan to move back all the loader routines to ~/loader. In the
	meantime I needed this patch. It doesn't affect any of the
	emulator code (its ifdefed for WineLib).

	* [misc/main.c]
	Cleaned up call to WinMain (now uses [toolkit/winmain.c]
	Ifdefed argument number checking when compiling the library.

	* [loader/wine.c]
	Modified to use load_(mz|ne)_header instead of doing a direct
	read.  When compiling the emulator it still uses the direct read
	for performance. 

	* [include/wine.h]
	Prototypes for loading routines.

	* [include/class.h]
	Added WINE_PACKED macro instead of __attribute__ ((packed))
