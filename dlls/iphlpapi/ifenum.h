 * This module implements network interface and address enumeration.  It's
 * meant to hide some problematic defines like socket(), and make iphlpapi
 * more portable.
 *
 * Like Windows, it uses a numeric index to identify an interface uniquely.
 * As implemented, an interface represents a UNIX network interface, virtual
 * or real, and thus can have 0 or 1 IP addresses associated with it.  (This
 * only supports IPv4.)
 * The indexes returned are not guaranteed to be contiguous, so don't call
 * getNumInterfaces() and assume the values [0,getNumInterfaces() - 1] will be
 * valid indexes; use getInterfaceIndexTable() instead.
 *
 * See also the companion file, ipstats.h, for functions related to getting
 * statistics.
