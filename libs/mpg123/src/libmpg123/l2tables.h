	copyright ?-2006 by the mpg123 project - free software under the terms of the LGPL 2.1
	see COPYING and AUTHORS files in distribution or http://mpg123.org
	initially written by Michael Hipp

	most other tables are calculated on program start (which is (of course)	not ISO-conform)
	Layer-3 huffman table is in huffman.h

	Note: runtime computation of those other tables is optional now, and only for
	floating point decoding.
