 Clock for Wine
 ==============
 
 This is a first attempt to realize a desktop clock for Wine as done in 
 Windows. It'a an early release and most of the code is still broken.

 Please see file TODO for things to do and keep the file ChangeLog
 up to date.

 Code is currently under heavy construction. Please direct patches and
 additions to my personal email address <mbaur@g26.ethz.ch>
