    <title>Configuring Wine</title>
    <para>
      Now that you hopefully managed to successfully install
      the Wine program files,
      this chapter will tell you how to configure the Wine environment
      properly to run your Windows programs.
    </para>
    <para>
      First, we'll give you an overview about which kinds of
      configuration and program execution aspects a fully configured
      Windows environment has to fulfill in order to ensure that many
      Windows programs run successfully without encountering any
      misconfigured or missing items.
      Next, we'll show you which easy helper programs exist
      to enable even novice users to complete the Wine environment
      configuration in a fast and easy way.
      The next section will explain the purpose of the Wine configuration file,
      and we'll list all of its settings.
      After that, the next section will detail the most important and
      unfortunately most difficult configuration part:
      how to configure the file system and DOS drive environment that
      Windows programs need.
      In the last step we'll tell you how to establish a working Windows
      registry base.
      Finally, the remaining parts of this chapter contain descriptions
      of specific Wine configuration items that might also be
      of interest to you.

          A Windows installation is a very complex structure. It consists of

              install things in specific predetermined locations. Most
              of these directories are expected to exist. But unlike
              Unix directory structures, most of these locations are
              not hardcoded, and can be queried via the Windows API
              and the registry. This places additional requirements on
              a Wine installation.

              System DLLs. In Windows, these usually reside in the
              <filename>system</filename> (or
              <filename>system32</filename>) directory. Some Windows
              programs check for their existence in these
              directories before attempting to load them. While Wine
              is able to load its own internal DLLs
              (<filename>.so</filename> files) when the program
              asks for a DLL, Wine does not simulate the presence of
              non-existent files.

          While the users are of course free to set up everything
          themselves, the Wine team will make the automated Wine source
          installation script, <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename>,
          do everything we find necessary to do; running the
          conventional <userinput>configure && make depend && make && make
            install</userinput> cycle is thus not recommended, unless
          you know what you're doing. At the moment,
          <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> is able to create a
          configuration file, install the registry, and create the
          directory structure itself.

	After you finished configuring Wine, you may run a Perl

        <title>Creating Or Modifying The Configuration File</title>
        <para>
	  If you just installed Wine for the first time and want to
	  finish Wine installation by configuring it now, then you could
	  use our sample configuration file <filename>config</filename>
	  (which can be found in the directory
	  <filename>documentation/samples/</filename> of the Wine source
	  code directory) as a base for adapting the Wine configuration
	  file to the settings you want.
	  First, I should mention that you should not forget to make
	  sure that any previous configuration file at
	  <filename>~/.wine/config</filename> has been safely moved out
	  of the way instead of simply overwriting it when you will now
	  copy over the sample configuration file.
        </para>
	<para>
	  If you don't have a pre-existing configuration file and thus
	  need to copy over our sample configuration file to the
	  standard Wine configuration file location, do in a
	  <glossterm>terminal</glossterm>:
          <screen>
  <prompt>$ </><userinput>mkdir ~/.wine/</>
  <prompt>$ </><userinput>cp <replaceable>dir_to_wine_source_code</replaceable>/documentation/samples/config ~/.wine/config</>
          </screen>
	  Otherwise, simply use the already existing configuration file
	  at <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Now you can start adapting the configuration file's settings with an
	  <glossterm>editor</glossterm> according to the documentation
	  below.
	  Note that you should <emphasis>only</emphasis> change
	  configuration file settings if wineserver is not running (in
	  other words: if your user doesn't have a Wine session running),
	  otherwise Wine won't use them - and even worse, wineserver will
	  overwrite them with the old settings once wineserver quits!!

  	    WARNING: if you use ttydrv here, then you won't be able to run
  	    a lot of Windows GUI programs (ttydrv is still pretty "broken"
  	    at running graphical apps). Thus this option is mainly interesting
  	    for e.g. embedded use of Wine in web server scripts.
  	    Note that ttydrv is still very lacking, so if it doesn't work,
  	    resort to using "xvfb", a virtual X11 server.
  	    Another way to run Wine without display would be to run X11
  	    via Xvnc, then connect to that VNC display using xvncviewer
  	    (that way you're still able to connect to your app and

          <para>
            Since the way X handles fonts is different from the way
            Windows does, wine uses a special mechanism to deal with
            them. It must scale them using the number defined in the
            "Resolution" setting. 60-120 are reasonable values, 96 is
            a nice in the middle one. If you have the real windows
            fonts available (<filename>&lt;dirs to
              wine>/documentation/ttfserver</filename> and
            <filename>fonts</filename>), this parameter will not be as
            important. Of course, it's always good to get your X fonts
            working acceptably in wine.
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>"Default" = "-adobe-times-"</programlisting>
            The default font wine uses. Fool around with it if you'd like.
          </para>
          <para>
  OPTIONAL:
          </para>
          <para>
            The <literal>Alias</literal> setting allows you to map an X font to a font
            used in wine. This is good for apps that need a special font you don't have,
            but a good replacement exists. The syntax is like so:
            <programlisting>
  "AliasX" = "[Fake windows name],[Real X name]"&lt;,optional "masking" section>
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Pretty straightforward. Replace "AliasX" with "Alias0",
            then "Alias1" and so on. The fake windows name is the name
            that the font will be under a windows app in wine. The
            real X name is the font name as seen by X (Run
            "xfontsel"). The optional "masking" section allows you to
            utilize the fake windows name you define. If it is not
            used, then wine will just try to extract the fake windows
            name itself and not use the value you enter.
          </para>
          <para>
            Here is an example of an alias without masking. The font will show up in windows
            apps as "Google".

            <programlisting>
  "Alias0" = "Foo,--google-"
            </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Here is an example with masking enabled. The font will show up as "Foo" in
            windows apps.
            <programlisting>
  "Alias1" = "Foo,--google-,subst"
            </programlisting>

            Even though it sounds like a lot of sections, these are
            all closely related. They are all for communications and
            parallel ports.
          </para>
          <para>
            The [serialports] section tells wine what serial ports it
            is allowed to use.

          </para>
          <para>
            Replace <literal>X</literal> with the number of the COM
            port in Windows (1-8) and <literal>Y</literal> with the
            number of it in <literal>X</literal> (Usually the number
            of the port in Windows minus 1). <literal>ComX</literal>
            can actually equal any device
            (<medialabel>/dev/modem</medialabel> is acceptable). It is
            not always necessary to define any COM ports (An optional
            setting). Here is an example:
            <programlisting>"Com1" = "/dev/ttyS0"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Use as many of these as you like in the section to define

          <para>
            The [parallelports] section sets up any parallel ports
            that will be allowed access under wine.
            <programlisting>"LptX" = "/dev/lpY"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Sounds familiar? Syntax is just like the COM port setting.
            Replace <literal>X</literal> with a value from 1-4 as it
            is in Windows and <literal>Y</literal> with a value from
            0-3 (<literal>Y</literal> is usually the value in windows
            minus 1, just like for COM ports). You don't always need
            to define a parallel port (AKA, it's optional). As with
            the other section, LptX can equal any device (Maybe
            <medialabel>/dev/printer</medialabel>). Here is an
            example:  <programlisting>"Lpt1" = "/dev/lp0"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            The [spooler] section will inform wine where to spool
            print jobs. Use this if you want to try printing. Wine
            docs claim that spooling is "rather primitive" at this
            time, so it won't work perfectly. <emphasis>It is optional.</emphasis> The only
            setting you use in this section works to map a port (LPT1,
            for example) to a file or a command. Here is an example,
            mapping LPT1 to the file <filename>out.ps</filename>:
            <programlisting>"LPT1:" = "out.ps"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            The following command maps printing jobs to LPT1 to the

                  A boolean setting (default: <literal>Y</literal>)
                  that affects the way Wine sets the computer name. The computer
                  name in the Windows world is the so-called <emphasis>NetBIOS name</emphasis>.
                  It is contained in the <varname>ComputerName</varname> in the registry entry
                  <varname>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName</varname>.
                </para>
                <para>
                  If this option is set to "Y" or missing, Wine will set the
                  NetBIOS name to the Unix host name of your computer, if
                  necessary truncated to 31 characters. The Unix hostname is the output
                  of the shell command <command>hostname</command>, up to but not
                  including the first dot ('.'). Among other things, this means that
                  Windows programs running under Wine cannot change the NetBIOS computer name.
                </para>
                <para>
                  If this option is set to "N", Wine will use the registry value above
                  to set the NetBIOS name. Only if the registry entry doesn't exist (usually
                  only during the first wine startup) it will use the Unix hostname as
                  usual. Windows programs can change the NetBIOS name. The change
                  will be effective after a "reboot", i.e. after restarting Wine.

        <title>Short Introduction</title>
        <para>
	  Wine emulates drives by placing their virtual drive roots to
	  user-configurable points in the Unix filesystem, so it's your
	  choice where <medialabel>C:</medialabel>'s root should be
	  (<filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> will even ask you). If
	  you choose, say, <filename>~/wine</filename> (or, in other
	  words, <filename>/home/user/wine</filename>, since "~"
	  indicates the home directory of a user), as the root of your
	  virtual drive <medialabel>C:</medialabel>, then you'd put this
	  into your Wine configuration file:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
[Drive C]
"Path" = "${HOME}/wine"
"Type" = "hd"
"Label" = "MS-DOS"
"Filesystem" = "win95"
        </programlisting>

        <para>
          With this configuration, what windows apps think of as
          "c:\windows\system" would map to
          <filename>/home/user/wine/windows/system</filename> in the UNIX
          filesystem. Note that you need to specify
          <literal>"Filesystem" = "win95"</literal>,
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          <literal>"Filesystem" = "unix"</literal>, to make Wine simulate a

	  Here's the fundamental layout that Windows programs and

	  intend to use a no-windows environment (not using an existing
	  Windows partition), then it is recommended to use either

      <sect2 id="config-drive-sections">
        <title>The [Drive x] Sections</title>
        <para>
            These sections are supposed to make certain Unix
            directory locations accessible to Wine as a DOS/Windows drive
            (drive 'x:') and thus accessible to Windows programs
            under the drive name you specified.
	    Every DOS/Windows program sort of expects at least a C:
	    drive (and sometimes also an A: floppy drive), so your
	    configuration file should at least contain the corresponding
	    sections, [Drive C] and [Drive A].
            You need to decide on whether you want to use an existing Windows
            partition as the C drive or whether you want to create your own
            Wine drive C directory tree somewhere (take care about
            permissions!).
            Each drive section may specify up to 6 different settings
            as explained below.
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>[Drive x]</programlisting>
          The above line begins the section for a drive whose letter is x
            (DOS notation: drive 'x:').
            You could e.g. create an equivalent to a drive 'C:'
            under DOS/Windows by using a [Drive C] section name.
	    Note that the drive letter is case insensitive.
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Path" = "/dir/to/path"</programlisting>
            This specifies the directory where the drive will begin.
            When Wine is browsing in drive x, it will be able
            to see the files that are in the directory
            <filename>/dir/to/path</filename> and below.
            (note that symlinks to directories won't get included!
            see "<link linkend="dirsymlinks">ShowDirSymlinks</link>"
            configuration setting)
            You can also make use of environment variables like $HOME here,
	    an example for using a <filename>mywinedrive</filename>
	    directory in your home dir would be
            <programlisting>"Path" = "${HOME}/mywinedrive"</programlisting>
            Don't forget to leave off the trailing slash!
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Type" = "hd|cdrom|network|floppy"</programlisting>
          Sets up the type of drive Wine will see it as. Type must
          equal one of the four <literal>floppy</literal>,
          <literal>hd</literal>, <literal>cdrom</literal>, or
          <literal>network</literal>. They are self-explanatory.
          (The |'s mean "Type = '&lt;one of the options&gt;'".)
          Usually, you choose "hd" for a drive ("hd" is default anyway).
	  For a home directory entry, it makes sense to choose
	  "network" sometimes, since some home directories are being
	  exported over the network via NFS and thus can have slow response
	  times.
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Label" = "blah"</programlisting>
            Defines the drive label. Generally only needed
            for programs that look for a special CD-ROM.
          The label may be up to 11 characters.
            Note that the preferred way of managing labels and serial numbers
            of CD-ROMs and floppies is to give Wine raw device access for
            reading these on a per-CD case (see "Device" below) instead of
            hardcoding one specific "Label".
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Serial" = "deadbeef"</programlisting>
          Tells Wine the serial number of the drive. A few programs with
          intense protection for pirating might need this, but otherwise
          it's not needed. Up to 8 characters and hexadecimal.
            Using a "Device" entry instead of hardcoding the "Serial" probably
            is a smarter choice.
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Filesystem" = "win95|unix|msdos"</programlisting>
          Sets up the way Wine looks at files on the drive.
          This setting controls the file name lookup and mapping of
          Wine to existing file systems on your PC, it does
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> tell anything about the filesystem
          used itself.

          <title>File system settings in the [wine] section</title>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Windows" = "c:\\windows"</programlisting>
          This tells Wine and Windows programs where the
          <filename>Windows</filename> directory is.  It is
          recommended to have this directory somewhere on your
          configured <medialabel>C</medialabel> drive, and it's also
          recommended to just call the directory "windows" (this is
          the default setup on Windows, and some stupid programs
          might rely on this).  So in case you chose a "Windows"
          setting of "c:\\windows" and you chose to set up a drive C
          e.g. at <filename>/usr/local/wine_c</filename>, the
          corresponding directory would be
          <filename>/usr/local/wine_c/windows</filename>.  Make one
          if you don't already have one. <emphasis>No trailing slash</emphasis> (<emphasis>not</emphasis>
          <filename>C:\\windows\</filename>)! Write access strongly
          recommended, as Windows programs always assume write access
            to the Windows directory!
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"System" = "c:\\windows\\system"</programlisting>
          This sets up where the windows system files are. The Windows
            system directory should reside below the directory used for the
          <literal>Windows</literal> setting.
            Thus when using the example above, the system directory would be
            <filename>/usr/local/wine_c/windows/system</filename>.
          Again, no trailing slash, and write access!
        </para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>"Temp" = "c:\\temp"</programlisting> This should
          be the directory you want your temp files stored in,
            /usr/local/wine_c/temp in our example.
          Again, no trailing slash, and <emphasis>write

        <para>
          Behaves like the <envar>PATH</envar> setting on UNIX
          boxes. When wine is run like <userinput>wine
            sol.exe</userinput>, if <filename>sol.exe</filename>
          resides in a directory specified in the
          <literal>Path</literal> setting, wine will run it (Of
          course, if <filename>sol.exe</filename> resides in the
          current directory, wine will run that one). Make sure it
          always has your <filename>windows</filename> directory and
          system directory (For this setup, it must have
          <filename>"c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system"</filename>).

        <para id="dirsymlinks">
          <programlisting>
"ShowDirSymlinks" = "1"
          </programlisting>
          Wine doesn't pass directory symlinks to Windows programs by
          default, as doing so may crash some programs that do
          recursive lookups of whole subdirectory trees
          whenever a directory symlink points back to itself or one of its
          parent directories.
          That's why we disallowed the use of directory symlinks
          and added this setting to reenable ("1") this functionality.
	  If you <emphasis>really</emphasis> need Wine to take into
	  account symlinked directories, then reenable it, but
	  <emphasis>be prepared for crashes</emphasis> in certain
	  Windows programs when using the above method! (in other words:
	  enabling it is certainly not recommended)

	  Windows uses a different (and inferior) way than Unix to describe the

	  to find this different way supported by the system.
	  Since we intend to run Windows programs on
	  a Unix system, we're in trouble, as we need to translate
	  between these different file access techniques.
	</para>
	<para>
          Windows uses drive letters to describe drives or
          any other form of storage media and to access files on them.
	  For example, common drive names are
	  <filename>C:</filename> for the main Windows system partition
	  on the first harddisk and <filename>A:</filename> for the
	  first floppy drive.
	  Also, Windows uses <filename>\</filename> (backslash) as the
	  directory separator sign, whereas Unix uses
	  <filename>/</filename> (slash).
	  Thus, an example document on the first data partition in
	  Windows might be accessed by the name of
	  <filename>D:\mywork\mydocument.txt</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  So much for the Windows way of doing things.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Well, the problem is, in Unix there is no such thing as
	  <quote>drive letters</quote>. Instead, Unix chose to go the
	  much better way of having one single uniform directory tree
	  (starting with the root directory
	  <filename>/</filename>), which has various storage devices
	  such as e.g. harddisk partitions appended at various directory
	  locations within the tree (an example would be
	  <filename>/data1/mywork</filename>, which is the first data
	  partition mounted/attached to a directory called data1 in the
	  root directory <filename>/</filename>; mywork is a sub
	  directory of the data partition file system that's mounted
	  under <filename>/data1</filename>).
	  In Unix, the Windows example document mentioned above could e.g.
	  be accessed by the name of
	  <filename>/data1/mywork/mydocument.txt</filename>,
	  provided that the administrator decided to mount (attach) the first
	  data partition at the directory /data1 inside the Unix
	  directory tree. Note that in Unix, the administrator can
	  <emphasis>choose</emphasis> any custom partition location he
	  wants (here, <filename>/data1</filename>), whereas in Windows the system
	  <emphasis>selects</emphasis> any drive letter it deems
	  suitable for the first data partition (here,
	  <filename>D:</filename>), and, even worse, if there is some
	  change in partition order, Windows automatically
	  <emphasis>changes</emphasis> the drive letter, and you might
	  suddenly find yourself with a first data partition at drive
	  letter <filename>E:</filename>, with all the file naming and
	  referencing confusion that entails. Thus, the Windows way of
	  using ever-changing drive letters is <emphasis>clearly
	  inferior</emphasis> to the Unix way of assigning
	  <emphasis>fixed</emphasis> directory tree locations for every
	  data storage medium.
	  As we'll see soon, fortunately this Windows limitation of
	  changing drive letters doesn't affect us in Wine at all, since
	  we can properly map <emphasis>never-changing</emphasis> drive letters to <emphasis>fixed</emphasis> locations inside the Unix directory tree (and even if the location of the respective Unix directory changes, we can still simply update the Wine drive mapping to reflect the updated location and at the same time keep the original drive letter).
	</para>
	<para>
	  OK, now that we know some theory about Windows and Unix drive
	  and filename mapping, it's probably time to ask how Wine
	  achieves the magic of mapping a Unix directory location to a
	  Windows drive...
	</para>
	<para>
          Wine chose to do the following:
	  In Wine, you don't assign some real physical storage medium
	  (such as a harddisk partition or similar) to each drive letter
	  mapping entry.
          Instead, you choose certain sub directory trees inside the Unix
          directory tree (that starts with <filename>/</filename>) that
          you would like to assign a drive letter to.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note that for every Unix sub directory tree that you intend to
	  start Windows programs in, it is <emphasis>absolutely
	  required</emphasis> to have a Wine drive mapping entry:
	</para>
	<para>
	  For example, if you had a publicly writable <quote>Windows
	  directory space</quote> under <filename>/usr/mywine</filename>, then in order to be
	  able to access this sub directory tree from Wine, you should
	  have a drive mapping entry that maps a certain drive letter
	  (for example, let's take drive letter <filename>P:</filename>)
	  either to <filename>/usr/mywine</filename> or <filename>/usr</filename> (to also access any directories belonging to the parent directory) or <filename>/</filename> (to also access any directory whatsoever on this system by this drive letter mapping). The DOS drive/directory location to access files in <filename>/usr/mywine</filename> <emphasis>in Wine</emphasis> in these configuration cases would then be <filename>P:\</filename> or <filename>P:\mywine</filename> or <filename>P:\usr\mywine</filename>, respectively.

          Because Wine is not yet complete, some programs will work
          better with native Windows DLLs than with Wine's
          replacements. Wine has been designed to make this possible.
          Here are some tips by Juergen Schmied (and others) on how to
          proceed. This assumes that your
          <filename>C:\windows</filename> directory in the configuration
          file does not point to a native Windows installation but is in
          a separate Unix file system. (For instance, <quote>C:\windows</quote> is

          Some people intend to use the data of an existing Windows partition

  	installed programs in a setup as original as possible.
  	Note that many Windows programs assume that they have full write

  	(see <link linkend="config-drive-vfat">Dealing with FAT/VFAT partitions</link>
  	on how to do that), or you'll have to copy over (some parts of) the Windows

  	We <emphasis>HIGHLY DISCOURAGE</emphasis> people from directly using a Windows partition with
  	write access as a base for Wine!! (some programs, notably
  	Explorer, corrupt large parts of the Windows partition in case
  	of an incorrect setup; you've been warned).
  	Not to mention that NTFS write support in Linux is still very

        <sect3>
          <title>Introduction</title>
          <para>
            Linux is able to access DOS and Windows file systems using
            either the FAT (older 8.3 DOS filesystems) or VFAT (newer
            Windows 95 or later long filename filesystems) modules.
            Mounted FAT or VFAT filesystems provide the primary means
            for which existing programs and their data are accessed
            through Wine for dual boot (Linux + Windows) systems.
          </para>
          <para>
            Wine maps mounted FAT filesystems, such as
            <filename>/c</filename>, to driver letters, such as
            <quote>c:</quote>, as indicated by the
            <filename>~/.wine/config</filename> file.  The following excerpt
            from a <filename>~/.wine/config</filename> file does this:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
  [Drive C]
  "Path" = "/c"
  "Type" = "hd"
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            Although VFAT filesystems are preferable to FAT filesystems
            for their long filename support, the term <quote>FAT</quote>
            will be used throughout the remainder of this document to
            refer to FAT filesystems and their derivatives. Also,
            <quote>/c</quote> will be used as the FAT mount point in
            examples throughout this document.
          </para>
          <para>
            Most modern Linux distributions either detect or allow
            existing FAT file systems to be configured so that they can be
            mounted, in a location such as <filename>/c</filename>,
            either persistently (on bootup) or on an as needed basis. In
            either case, by default, the permissions will probably be
            configured so that they look like:

          <title>Running Wine as root</title>
          <para>
            Running Wine as root is the easiest and most thorough way of giving
            programs that Wine runs unrestricted access to FAT files systems.
            Running wine as root also allows programs to do things unrelated
            to FAT filesystems, such as listening to ports that are less than
            1024.  Running Wine as root is dangerous since there is no limit to
            what the program can do to the system, so it's <emphasis>HIGHLY DISCOURAGED</emphasis>.

          <title>Mounting FAT filesystems</title>
          <para>
            The FAT filesystem can be mounted with permissions less restrictive
            than the default.  This can be done by either changing the user that
            mounts the FAT filesystem or by explicitly changing the permissions
            that the FAT filesystem is mounted with.  The permissions are
            inherited from the process that mounts the FAT filesystem.  Since the
            process that mounts the FAT filesystem is usually a startup script
            running as root the FAT filesystem inherits root's permissions.  This
            results in the files on the FAT filesystem having permissions similar
            to files created by root.  For example:
          </para>
          <screen>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>whoami</userinput>
  <computeroutput>root</computeroutput>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>touch root_file</userinput>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>ls -l root_file</userinput>
  <computeroutput></computeroutput>-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Dec 10 00:20 root_file
          </screen>
          <para>
            which matches the owner, group and permissions of files seen
            on the FAT filesystem except for the missing 'x's.  The
            permissions on the FAT filesystem can be changed by changing
            root's umask (unset permissions bits).  For example:
          </para>
          <screen>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umount /c</userinput>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umask</userinput>

  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umask 073</userinput>

  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>cd /c</userinput>
  <prompt>/c></prompt><userinput>ls -l</userinput>

          </screen>
          <para>
            Mounting the FAT filesystem with a umask of
            <literal>000</literal> gives all users complete control over
            it. Explicitly specifying the permissions of the FAT
            filesystem when it is mounted provides additional control.
            There are three mount options that are relevant to FAT
            permissions: <literal>uid</literal>, <literal>gid</literal>
            and <literal>umask</literal>.  They can each be specified
            when the filesystem is manually mounted.  For example:
          </para>
          <screen>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>umount /c</userinput>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>mount -o uid=500 -o gid=500 -o umask=002 /c</userinput>
  <prompt>~></prompt><userinput>cd /c</userinput>

          <title>Shadowing FAT filesystems</title>
          <para>
            Shadowing provides a finer granularity of control.  Parts of
            the original FAT filesystem can be copied so that the
            program can safely work with those copied parts while
            the program continues to directly read the remaining
            parts.  This is done with symbolic links. For example,
            consider a system where a program named
            <application>AnApp</application> must be able to read and
            write to the <filename>c:\windows</filename> and
            <filename>c:\AnApp</filename> directories as well as have
            read access to the entire FAT filesystem.  On this system
            the FAT filesystem has default permissions which should not
            be changed for security reasons or can not be changed due to
            lack of root access.  On this system a shadow directory
            might be set up in the following manner:
          </para>

          <para>
          The above gives everyone complete read and write access to
          the <filename>windows</filename> and
          <filename>AnApp</filename> directories while only root has
          write access to all other directories.

        Until now, your only possibility of specifying drive volume
        labels and serial numbers was to set them manually in the wine
        configuration file. By now, wine can read them directly from the
        device as well. This may be useful for many Win 9x games or
        for setup programs distributed on CD-ROMs that check for
        volume label.

        <title>How To Set Up?</title>
        <para>
          Reading labels and serial numbers just works automagically
          if you specify a <literal>"Device" =</literal> line in the
          [Drive x] section in your <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>.
          Note that the device has to exist and must be accessible by the user
          running Wine if you do this, though.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you don't want to read labels and serial numbers directly from
          the device, then you should give fixed
          <literal>"Label" =</literal> or <literal>"Serial" =</literal>
          entries in <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>, as Wine returns
          these entries instead if no device is given. If they don't
          exist, then Wine will return default values (label
          <literal>Drive X</literal> and serial
          <literal>12345678</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
          If you want to give a <literal>"Device" =</literal> entry
          <emphasis>only</emphasis> for drive raw sector accesses,
        but not for reading the volume info from the device (i.e. you want
        a <emphasis>fixed</emphasis>, preconfigured label), you need
          to specify <literal>"ReadVolInfo" = "0"</literal> to tell Wine
          to skip the volume reading.

</para>

<para>
  The wine configuration file directives [DllDefaults]
  and [DllOverrides] are the subject of some confusion. The
  overall purpose of most of these directives are clear enough,
  though - given a choice, should Wine use its own built-in
  DLLs, or should it use <filename>.DLL</filename> files found
  in an existing Windows installation? This document explains
  how this feature works.

<sect3>
  <title>The [DllPairs] section</title>
  <para>
    At one time, there was a section called [DllPairs] in the
    default configuration file, but this has been obsoleted
    because the pairing information has now been embedded into
    Wine itself. (The purpose of this section was merely to be
    able to issue warnings if the user attempted to pair
    codependent 16-bit/32-bit DLLs of different types.) If you
    still have this in your <filename>~/.wine/config</filename> or
    <filename>wine.conf</filename>, you may safely delete it.
  </para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
  <title>The [DllOverrides] section</title>
  <para>
    This section specifies how you want specific DLLs to be
    handled, in particular whether you want to use "native" DLLs
    or not, if you have some from a real Windows configuration.
    Because built-ins do not mix seamlessly with native DLLs yet,
    certain DLL dependencies may be problematic, but workarounds
    exist in Wine for many popular DLL configurations. Also see
    WWN's [16]Status Page to figure out how well your favorite
    DLL is implemented in Wine.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is of course also possible to override these settings by
    explictly using Wine's <parameter>--dll</parameter>
    command-line option (see the man page for details).  Some
    hints for choosing your optimal configuration (listed by

<sect2 id="config-system-dlls">
<title>System DLLs</title>
<para>
  The Wine team has determined that it is necessary to create
  fake DLL files to trick many programs that check for
  file existence to determine whether a particular feature
  (such as Winsock and its TCP/IP networking) is available. If
  this is a problem for you, you can create empty files in the
  configured <filename>c:\windows\system</filename> directory
  to make the program think it's there, and Wine's built-in DLL
  will be loaded when the program actually asks for it.
  (Unfortunately, <filename>tools/wineinstall</filename> does
  not create such empty files itself.)
</para>
<para>
  Applications sometimes also try to inspect the version
  resources from the physical files (for example, to determine
  the DirectX version). Empty files will not do in this case,
  it is rather necessary to install files with complete
  version resources. This problem is currently being worked
  on. In the meantime, you may still need to grab some real
  DLL files to fool these apps with.
</para>
<para>
  And there are of course DLLs that wine does not currently
  implement very well (or at all). If you do not have a real
  Windows you can steal necessary DLLs from, you can always
  get some from one of the Windows DLL archive sites
  that can be found via internet search engine.
  Please make sure to obey any licenses on the DLLs you fetch...
  (some are redistributable, some aren't).
</para>

<title>Missing DLLs</title>

<para>
  Written by &name-andreas-mohr; <email>&email-andreas-mohr;</email>
</para>

<para>
  In case Wine complains about a missing DLL, you should check whether
  this file is a publicly available DLL or a custom DLL belonging
  to your program (by searching for its name on the internet).
  If you managed to get hold of the DLL, then you should make sure
  that Wine is able to find and load it.
  DLLs usually get loaded according to the mechanism of the
  SearchPath() function.
  This function searches directories in the following order:

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	The directory the program was started from.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	The current directory.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	The PATH variable directories.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  In short: either put the required DLL into your program
  directory (might be ugly), or usually put it into the Windows system
  directory. Just find out its directory by having a look at the Wine
  configuration file variable "System" (which indicates the location of the
  Windows system directory) and the associated drive entry.
  Note that you probably shouldn't use NT-based native DLLs,
  since Wine's NT API support is somewhat weaker than its Win9x
  API support (thus leading to even worse compatibility with NT DLLs
  than with a no-windows setup!), so better use Win9x native DLLs
  instead or no native DLLs at all.

<title>Configuring the graphics driver (x11drv, ttydrv etc.)</title>

<para>
Wine currently supports several different display subsystems
(graphics / text) that are available on various operating
systems today.
For each of these, Wine implements its own interfacing driver.
This section explains how to select one of these drivers
and how to further configure the respective driver.
Once you're finished with that, you can consider your Wine installation
to be finished.
</para>

<para>
The display drivers currently implemented in Wine are:
x11drv, which is used for interfacing to X11 graphics
(the one you'll most likely want to use) and ttydrv
(used for text mode console apps mainly that don't really need
any graphics output).
Once you have decided which display driver to use, it is chosen
with the <literal>GraphicsDriver</literal> option in the
[wine] section of <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>.

</para>

<sect3>
  <title>x11drv modes of operation</title>

  <para>
    The x11drv driver consists of two conceptually distinct
    pieces, the graphics driver (GDI part), and the windowing
    driver (USER part). Both of these are linked into the
    <filename>libx11drv.so</filename> module, though (which you
    load with the <literal>GraphicsDriver</literal> option). In
    Wine, running on X11, the graphics driver must draw on
    drawables (window interiors) provided by the windowing
    driver. This differs a bit from the Windows model, where the
    windowing system creates and configures device contexts
    controlled by the graphics driver, and programs are
    allowed to hook into this relationship anywhere they like.
    Thus, to provide any reasonable tradeoff between
    compatibility and usability, the x11drv has three different
    modes of operation.

<title>Setting the Windows and DOS version value</title>

<para>
Written by &name-andreas-mohr; <email>&email-andreas-mohr;</email>
Oct 18 2002
</para>

<para>
The windows and DOS version value a program gets e.g. by calling the
Windows function GetVersion() plays a very important role:
If your Wine installation for whatever reason fails to provide
to your program the correct version value that it expects,
then the program might assume some very bad things and fail (in
the worst case even silently!).

Fortunately Wine contains some more or less intelligent Windows
version guessing algorithm that will try to guess the Windows
version a program might expect and pass that one on to the
program.

Thus you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> lightly configure a version value, as this will be a "forced" value and thus turn out to be rather harmful to proper operation. In other words: only explicitly set a Windows version value in case Wine's own version detection was unable to provide the correct Windows version and the program fails.

instead of just taking the characters returned by the X
server. This means that Wine now needs to have a mapping from
X keys to the scancodes these programs expect.
</para>
<para>
On startup, Wine will try to recognize the active X layout by
seeing if it matches any of the defined tables. If it does,
everything is alright. If not, you need to define it.
</para>
<para>
To do this, open the file
<filename>dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c</filename> and take a look
at the existing tables. Make a backup copy of it, especially
if you don't use CVS.
</para>
<para>
What you really would need to do, is find out which scancode
each key needs to generate.  Find it in the
<function>main_key_scan</function> table, which looks like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>
static const int main_key_scan[MAIN_LEN] =
{
/* this is my (102-key) keyboard layout, sorry if it doesn't quite match yours */
0x29,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08,0x09,0x0A,0x0B,0x0C,0x0D,
0x10,0x11,0x12,0x13,0x14,0x15,0x16,0x17,0x18,0x19,0x1A,0x1B,
0x1E,0x1F,0x20,0x21,0x22,0x23,0x24,0x25,0x26,0x27,0x28,0x2B,
0x2C,0x2D,0x2E,0x2F,0x30,0x31,0x32,0x33,0x34,0x35,
0x56 /* the 102nd key (actually to the right of l-shift) */
};
</programlisting>
<para>
Next, assign each scancode the characters imprinted on the
keycaps. This was done (sort of) for the US 101-key keyboard,
which you can find near the top in
<filename>keyboard.c</filename>. It also shows that if there
is no 102nd key, you can skip that.
</para>
<para>
However, for most international 102-key keyboards, we have
done it easy for you. The scancode layout for these already
pretty much matches the physical layout in the
<function>main_key_scan</function>, so all you need to do is
to go through all the keys that generate characters on your
main keyboard (except spacebar), and stuff those into an
appropriate table. The only exception is that the 102nd key,
which is usually to the left of the first key of the last line
(usually <keycap>Z</keycap>), must be placed on a separate
line after the last line.
</para>
<para>
For example, my Norwegian keyboard looks like this
</para>
<screen>
§  !  "  #  ¤  %  &  /  (  )  =  ?  `  Back-
|  1  2@ 3£ 4$ 5  6  7{ 8[ 9] 0} +  \´ space

			     ¨~
				Enter
Caps A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  Ø  Æ  *
Lock                                  '

Sh- > Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  ;  :  _  Shift
ift &lt;                      ,  .  -

Ctrl  Alt       Spacebar       AltGr  Ctrl
</screen>
<para>
Note the 102nd key, which is the <keycap>&lt;></keycap> key, to
the left of <keycap>Z</keycap>. The character to the right of
the main character is the character generated by
<keycap>AltGr</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
This keyboard is defined as follows:
</para>
<programlisting>
static const char main_key_NO[MAIN_LEN][4] =
{
"|§","1!","2\"@","3#£","4¤$","5%","6&","7/{","8([","9)]","0=}","+?","\\´",
"qQ","wW","eE","rR","tT","yY","uU","iI","oO","pP","åÅ","¨^~",
"aA","sS","dD","fF","gG","hH","jJ","kK","lL","øØ","æÆ","'*",
"zZ","xX","cC","vV","bB","nN","mM",",;",".:","-_",
"&lt;>"
};
</programlisting>
<para>
Except that " and \ needs to be quoted with a backslash, and
that the 102nd key is on a separate line, it's pretty
straightforward.
</para>
<para>
After you have written such a table, you need to add it to the
<function>main_key_tab[]</function> layout index table. This
will look like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
static struct {
WORD lang, ansi_codepage, oem_codepage;
const char (*key)[MAIN_LEN][4];
} main_key_tab[]={
...
...
{MAKELANGID(LANG_NORWEGIAN,SUBLANG_DEFAULT),  1252, 865, &amp;main_key_NO},
...
</programlisting>
<para>
After you have added your table, recompile Wine and test that
it works. If it fails to detect your table, try running
</para>
<screen>
wine --debugmsg +key,+keyboard >& key.log
      </screen>
      <para>
        and look in the resulting <filename>key.log</filename> file to
        find the error messages it gives for your layout.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that the <constant>LANG_*</constant> and
        <constant>SUBLANG_*</constant> definitions are in
        <filename>include/winnls.h</filename>, which you might need to
        know to find out which numbers your language is assigned, and
        find it in the debugmsg output. The numbers will be
        <literal>(SUBLANG * 0x400 + LANG)</literal>, so, for example
        the combination <literal>LANG_NORWEGIAN (0x14)</literal> and
        <literal>SUBLANG_DEFAULT (0x1)</literal> will be (in hex)
        <literal>14 + 1*400 = 414</literal>, so since I'm Norwegian, I
        could look for <literal>0414</literal> in the debugmsg output
        to find out why my keyboard won't detect.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once it works, submit it to the Wine project. If you use CVS,
        you will just have to do
      </para>
      <screen>
cvs -z3 diff -u dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c > layout.diff
      </screen>
      <para>
        from your main Wine directory, then submit
        <filename>layout.diff</filename> to
        <email>wine-patches@winehq.com</email> along with a brief note
        of what it is.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you don't use CVS, you need to do
      </para>
      <screen>
diff -u the_backup_file_you_made dlls/x11drv/keyboard.c > layout.diff
      </screen>
      <para>
        and submit it as explained above.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you did it right, it will be included in the next Wine
        release, and all the troublesome programs (especially
        remote-control programs) and games that use scancodes will
        be happily using your keyboard layout, and you won't get those
        annoying fixme messages either.
      </para>
      <para>
        Good luck.

      <title>Using ODBC</title>
      <para>
        This section describes how ODBC works within Wine and how to configure
        it to do what you want (if it can do what you want).
      </para>
      <para>
        The ODBC system within Wine, as with the printing system, is designed
        to hook across to the Unix system at a high level.  Rather than
        ensuring that all the windows code works under wine it uses a suitable
        Unix ODBC provider, such as UnixODBC.  Thus if you configure Wine to
        use the built-in odbc32.dll, that Wine DLL will interface to your
        Unix ODBC package and let that do the work, whereas if you configure
        Wine to use the native odbc32.dll it will try to use the native
        ODBC32 drivers etc.
      </para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Using a Unix ODBC system with Wine</title>
        <para>
          The first step in using a Unix ODBC system with Wine is, of course,
          to get the Unix ODBC system working itself.  This may involve
          downloading code or RPMs etc.  There are several Unix ODBC systems
          available; the one the author is used to is unixODBC (with the
          IBM DB2 driver). Typically such systems will include a tool, such
          as <command>isql</command>, which will allow you to access the data from the command
          line so that you can check that the system is working.
        </para>
        <para>
          The next step is to hook the Unix ODBC library to the wine built-in
          odbc32 DLL.  The built-in odbc32 (currently) looks to the
          environment variable <emphasis>LIB_ODBC_DRIVER_MANAGER</emphasis>
          for the name of the ODBC library.  For example in the author's
          .bashrc file is the line:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
export LIB_ODBC_DRIVER_MANAGER=/usr/lib/libodbc.so.1.0.0
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          If that environment variable is not set then it looks for a
          library called libodbc.so and so you can add a symbolic link to
          equate that to your own library.  For example as root you could
          run the commands:
        </para>
        <screen>
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>ln -s libodbc.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib/libodbc.so</userinput>
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>/sbin/ldconfig</userinput>
        </screen>
        <para>
          The last step in configuring this is to ensure that Wine is set up
          to run the built-in version of odbc32.dll, by modifying the DLL
          configuration.  This built-in DLL merely acts as a stub between the
          calling code and the Unix ODBC library.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you have any problems then you can use the debugmsg channel
          odbc32 to trace what is happening.  One word of warning.  Some
          programs actually cheat a little and bypass the ODBC library.  For
          example the Crystal Reports engine goes to the registry to check on
          the DSN.  The fix for this is documented at unixODBC's site where
          there is a section on using unixODBC with Wine.
