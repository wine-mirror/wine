        <title>Processes and threads: in underlying OS and in Windows</title>

        <para>
          Before going into the depths of debugging in Wine, here's
          a small overview of process and thread handling in Wine.
          It has to be clear that there are two different beasts:
          processes/threads from the Unix point of view and
          processes/threads from a Windows point of view.
        </para>
        <para>
          Each Windows' thread is implemented as a Unix process (under
          Linux using the <function>clone</function> syscall), meaning
          that all threads of a same Windows' process share the same
          (unix) address space.
        </para>
        <para>
          In the following:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><varname>W-process</varname> means a process in Windows' terminology</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><varname>U-process</varname> means a process in Unix' terminology</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><varname>W-thread</varname> means a thread in Windows' terminology</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
          A <varname>W-process</varname> is made of one or several
          <varname>W-threads</varname>. Each
          <varname>W-thread</varname> is mapped to one and only one
          <varname>U-process</varname>. All
          <varname>U-processes</varname> of a same
          <varname>W-process</varname> share the same address space.
        </para>
        <para>
          Each Unix process can be identified by two values:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the Unix process id (<varname>upid</varname> in the following)</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>the Windows's thread id (<varname>tid</varname>)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
          Each Windows' process has also a Windows' process id
          (<varname>wpid</varname> in the following). It must be clear
          that <varname>upid</varname> and <varname>wpid</varname> are
          different and shall not be used instead of the other.
        </para>
        <para>
          <varname>Wpid</varname> and <varname>tid</varname> are
          defined (Windows) system wide. They must not be confused
          with process or thread handles which, as any handle, is an
          indirection to a system object (in this case process or
          thread). A same process can have several different handles
          on the same kernel object. The handles can be defined as
          local (the values is only valid in a process), or system
          wide (the same handle can be used by any
          <varname>W-process</varname>).
        </para>

        <title>Wine, debugging and WineDbg</title>

        <para>
          When talking of debugging in Wine, there are at least two
          levels to think of:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the Windows' debugging API.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>the Wine integrated debugger, dubbed
              <command>WineDbg</command>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
          Wine implements most of the Windows' debugging API (the
          part in <filename>KERNEL32.DLL</filename>, not the one in
          <filename>IMAGEHLP.DLL</filename>), and allows any program
          (emulated or Winelib) using that API to debug a
          <varname>W-process</varname>.
        </para>
        <para>
          <command>WineDbg</command> is a Winelib application making
          use of this API to allow debugging both any Wine or Winelib
          applications as well as Wine itself (kernel and all DLLs).

        <title>Starting a process</title>

        <para>
          Any application (either a Windows' native executable, or a
          Winelib application) can be run through
          <command>WineDbg</command>. Command line options and tricks
          are the same as for wine:
        </para>

        <title>Attaching</title>

        <para>
          <command>WineDbg</command> can also be launched without any
          command line argument: <command>WineDbg</command> is started
          without any attached process. You can get a list of running
          <varname>W-processes</varname> (and their
          <varname>wpid</varname>'s) using the <command>walk
            process</command> command, and then, with the
          <command>attach</command> command, pick up the
          <varname>wpid</varname> of the <varname>W-process</varname>
          you want to debug. This is (for now) a neat feature for the
          following reasons:

      <sect2 id="dbg-on-exception">
        <title id="dbg-exception-title">On exceptions</title>

        <para>
          When something goes wrong, Windows tracks this as an
          exception. Exceptions exist for segmentation violation,
          stack overflow, division by zero...
        </para>
        <para>
          When an exception occurs, Wine checks if the <varname>W-process</varname> is
          debugged. If so, the exception event is sent to the
          debugger, which takes care of it: end of the story. This
          mechanism is part of the standard Windows' debugging API.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the <varname>W-process</varname> is not debugged, Wine
          tries to launch a debugger. This debugger (normally
          <command>WineDbg</command>, see III Configuration for more
          details), at startup, attaches to the
          <varname>W-process</varname> which generated the exception
          event. In this case, you are able to look at the causes of
          the exception, and either fix the causes (and continue
          further the execution) or dig deeper to understand what went
          wrong.
        </para>
        <para>
          If <command>WineDbg</command> is the standard debugger, the
          <command>pass</command> and <command>cont</command> commands
          are the two ways to let the process go further for the
          handling of the  exception event.
        </para>
        <para>
          To be more precise on the way Wine (and Windows) generates
          exception events, when a fault occurs (segmentation
          violation, stack overflow...), the event is first sent to
          the debugger (this is known as a first chance exception).
          The debugger can give two answers:
        </para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>continue:</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                the debugger had the ability to correct what's
                generated the exception, and is now able to continue
                process execution.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>pass:</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                the debugger couldn't correct the cause of the
                first chance exception. Wine will now try to walk
                the list of exception handlers to see if one of them
                can handle the exception. If no exception handler is
                found, the exception is sent once again to the
                debugger to indicate the failure of the exception
                handling.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
        <note>
          <para>
            since some of Wine's code uses exceptions and
            <function>try/catch</function> blocks to provide some
            functionality, <command>WineDbg</command> can be entered
            in such cases with segv exceptions. This happens, for
            example, with <function>IsBadReadPtr</function> function.
            In that case, the <command>pass</command> command shall be
            used, to let the handling of the exception to be done by
            the <function>catch</function> block in
            <function>IsBadReadPtr</function>.

	  You can stop the debugger while it's running by hitting

        <para>
	  Wine supports the new XP APIs, allowing for a debugger to
	  detach from a program being debugged (see
	  <command>detach</command> command). Unfortunately, as the
	  debugger cannot, for now, neither clear its internal
	  information, nor restart a new process, the debugger, after
	  detaching itself, cannot do much except being quited.

              in a valid selector, popping a segmentregister from the
              stack or the like. When reporting a crash, report this

              Logging in this guide for more information. You might
              also try to run the program in <command>gdb</command>
              instead of using the WINE-debugger. If you do that, use
              <parameter>handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint</parameter> to
              disable the handling of seg faults inside
              <command>gdb</command> (needed for Win16).

            <para>
              You can also set a breakpoint for that function. Start wine 
              useing <command>winedbg</command> instead of 
              <command>wine</command>. Once the debugger is is running enter 
              <command>break</command> <parameter>KERNEL_LSTRLEN</parameter>
              (replace by function you want to debug, CASE IS RELEVANT) 
              to set a breakpoint.  Then
              use <command>continue</command> to start normal
              program-execution. Wine will stop if it reaches the
              breakpoint. If the program isn't yet at the crashing call
              of that function, use <command>continue</command> again
              until you are about to enter that function. You may now
              proceed with single-stepping the function until you reach
              the point of crash. Use the other debugger commands to
              print registers and the like.

          Start the program with <command>winedbg</command> instead of
          <command>wine</command>. When the program locks up switch to the 
          winedbg terminal and press 
          <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>. this
          will stop the program and let you debug the program as you would for

        <title>Program reports an error with a Messagebox</title>

        <para>
          Sometimes programs are reporting failure using more or
          less nondescript messageboxes. We can debug this using the
          same method as Crashes, but there is one problem... For
          setting up a message box the program also calls Wine
          producing huge chunks of debug code.
        </para>
        <para>
          Since the failure happens usually directly before setting up
          the Messagebox you can start winedbg and set a
          breakpoint at <function>MessageBoxA</function> (called by win16
          and win32 programs) and proceed with
          <command>continue</command>. With <parameter>--debugmsg
            +all</parameter> Wine will now stop directly before setting
          up the Messagebox. Proceed as explained above.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also run wine using <command>wine -debugmsg +relay
            program.exe 2>&1 | less -i</command> and in
          <command>less</command> search for <quote>MessageBox</quote>.

        <title>Disassembling programs:</title>

        <para>
          You may also try to disassemble the offending program to
          check for undocumented features and/or use of them.
        </para>
        <para>
          The best, freely available, disassembler for Win16 programs is
          <application>Windows Codeback</application>, archivename
          <filename>wcbxxx.zip</filename>, which usually can be found in
          the <filename>Cica-Mirror</filename> subdirectory on the WINE
          ftpsites. (See <filename>ANNOUNCE</filename>).
        </para>
        <para>
          Disassembling win32 programs is possible using
          <application>Windows Disassembler 32</application>, archivename
          something like <filename>w32dsm87.zip</filename> (or similar)
          on <systemitem class="systemname">ftp.winsite.com</systemitem>
          and mirrors.  The shareware version does not allow saving of
          disassembly listings. You can also use the newer (and in the
          full version better) <application>Interactive
            Disassembler</application> (IDA) from the ftp sites mentioned
          at the end of the document. Understanding disassembled code is
          mostly a question of exercise.
        </para>
        <para>
          Most code out there uses standard C function entries (for it
          is usually  written in C). Win16 function entries usually
          look like that:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
push bp
mov bp, sp
... function code ..
retf XXXX 	&lt;--------- XXXX is number of bytes of arguments
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          This is a <function>FAR</function> function with no local
          storage. The arguments usually start at
          <literal>[bp+6]</literal> with increasing offsets. Note, that
          <literal>[bp+6]</literal> belongs to the
          <emphasis>rightmost</emphasis> argument, for exported win16
          functions use the PASCAL calling convention. So, if we use
          <function>strcmp(a,b)</function> with <parameter>a</parameter>
          and <parameter>b</parameter> both 32 bit variables
          <parameter>b</parameter> would be at <literal>[bp+6]</literal>
          and <parameter>a</parameter> at <literal>[bp+10]</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          Most functions make also use of local storage in the stackframe:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
enter 0086, 00
... function code ...
leave
retf XXXX
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          This does mostly the same as above, but also adds
          <literal>0x86</literal> bytes of stackstorage, which is
          accessed using <literal>[bp-xx]</literal>. Before calling a
          function, arguments are pushed on the stack using something
          like this:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
push word ptr [bp-02]	&lt;- will be at [bp+8]
push di			&lt;- will be at [bp+6]
call KERNEL.LSTRLEN
        </programlisting>
        <para>
          Here first the selector and then the offset to the passed
          string are pushed.

        <title>Debugging Tips</title>

        <para>
          Here are some useful debugging tips, added by Andreas Mohr:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If you have a program crashing at such an early loader phase that you can't
              use the Wine debugger normally, but Wine already executes the program's
              start code, then you may use a special trick. You should do a
              <programlisting>
wine --debugmsg +relay program
              </programlisting>
              to get a listing of the functions the program calls in its start function.
              Now you do a
              <programlisting>
winedbg winfile.exe
              </programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
              This way, you get into <command>winedbg</command>. Now you
              can set a breakpoint on any function the program calls in
              the start function and just type <userinput>c</userinput>
              to bypass the eventual calls of Winfile to this function
              until you are finally at the place where this function gets
              called by the crashing start function. Now you can proceed
              with your debugging as usual.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If you try to run a program and it quits after showing an error messagebox,
              the problem can usually be identified in the return value of one of the
              functions executed before <function>MessageBox()</function>.
              That's why you should re-run the program with e.g.
              <programlisting>
wine --debugmsg +relay &lt;program name> &>relmsg
              </programlisting>
              Then do a <command>more relmsg</command> and search for the
              last occurrence of a call to the string "MESSAGEBOX". This is a line like
              <programlisting>
Call USER.1: MESSAGEBOX(0x0000,0x01ff1246 "Runtime error 219 at 0004:1056.",0x00000000,0x1010) ret=01f7:2160 ds=01ff
              </programlisting>
              In my example the lines before the call to

              I think that the call to <function>MessageBox()</function>
              in this example is <emphasis>not</emphasis> caused by a
              wrong result value of some previously executed function
              (it's happening quite often like that), but instead the
              messagebox complains about a runtime error at
              <literal>0x0004:0x1056</literal>.
            </para>
            <para>
              As the segment value of the address is only
              <literal>4</literal>, I think that that is only an internal
              program value. But the offset address reveals something
              quite interesting: Offset <literal>1056</literal> is
              <emphasis>very</emphasis> close to the return address of
              <function>FREELIBRARY()</function>:

              runtime error occurred. But be careful! In some cases you don't have to
              disassemble the main program, but instead some DLL called by it in order to find
              the correct place where the runtime error occurred. That can be determined by

          <listitem>
            <para>
              Linear addresses can be everything from 0x0 up to
              0xffffffff.  In Wine on Linux they are often around
              e.g. 0x08000000, 0x00400000 (std. Win32 program load
              address), 0x40000000.  Every Win32 process has its own
              private 4GB address space (that is, from 0x0 up to
              0xffffffff).

            Win16 "enhanced mode": segmented addresses.
          </term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              These are the "normal" Win16 addresses, called SEGPTR.
              They have a segment:offset notation, e.g. 0x01d7:0x0012.
              The segment part usually is a "selector", which *always*
              has the lowest 3 bits set.  Some sample selectors are
              0x1f7, 0x16f, 0x8f.  If these bits are set except for
              the lowest bit, as e.g. with 0x1f6,xi then it might be a
              handle to global memory. Just set the lowest bit to get
              the selector in these cases.  A selector kind of
              "points" to a certain linear (see above) base address.
              It has more or less three important attributes: segment
              base address, segment limit, segment access rights.
            </para>
            <para>
              Example:
            </para>
            <para>
              Selector 0x1f7 (0x40320000, 0x0000ffff, r-x) So 0x1f7
              has a base address of 0x40320000, the segment's last
              address is 0x4032ffff (limit 0xffff), and it's readable
              and executable.  So an address of 0x1f7:0x2300 would be
              the linear address of 0x40322300.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>

            DOS/Win16 "standard mode"
          </term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              They, too, have a segment:offset notation.  But they are
              completely different from "normal" Win16 addresses, as
              they just represent at most 1MB of memory: The segment
              part can be anything from 0 to 0xffff, and it's the same
              with the offset part.
            </para>
            <para>
              Now the strange thing is the calculation that's behind
              these addresses: Just calculate segment*16 + offset in
              order to get a "linear DOS" address.  So
              e.g. 0x0f04:0x3628 results in 0xf040 + 0x3628 = 0x12668.
              And the highest address you can get is 0xfffff (1MB), of
              course.  In Wine, this "linear DOS" address of 0x12668
              has to be added to the linear base address of the
              corresponding DOS memory allocated for dosmod in order
              to get the true linear address of a DOS seg:offs
              address.  And make sure that you're doing this in the
              correct process with the correct linear address space,
              of course ;-)

                  (the next event  which is the exception event is of
                  course relevant), that option is likely to be

                  An exception can generate two debug events. The
                  first one is passed to the debugger (known as a
                  first chance) just after the exception. The debugger
                  can then decides either to resume execution (see
                  <command>WineDbg</command>'s <command>cont</command>
                  command) or pass the exception up to the exception
                  handler chain in the program (if it exists)
                  (<command>WineDbg</command> implements this through the
                  <command>pass</command> command). If none of the
                  exception handlers takes care of the exception, the
                  exception event is sent again to the debugger (known
                  as last chance exception). You cannot pass on a last
                  exception. When the
                  <varname>BreakOnFirstChance</varname> exception is
                  <literal>TRUE</literal>, then winedbg is entered for
                  both first and last chance execptions (to
                  <literal>FALSE</literal>, it's only entered for last
                  chance exceptions).

        </para>
        <para>
          You need to attach the unix debugger to the correct unix

          When running the emulator, usually the first two
          <varname>upids</varname> are for the Windows' application
          running the desktop, the first thread of the application is
          generally the third <varname>upid</varname>; when running a

          <para>
            Even if latest <command>gdb</command> implements the

            thread abstraction used for implementing Windows' thread
            is not 100% mapped onto the linux posix threads
            implementation. It means that you'll have to spawn a
            different <command>gdb</command> session for each Windows'
            thread you wish to debug.
