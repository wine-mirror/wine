      <para>
	As described in the Wine User Guide's CUI section, Wine
	manipulates three kinds of "consoles" in order to support
	properly the Win32 CUI API.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following table describes the main implementation
	differences between the three approaches.

		<entry>
		  No specific Win32 object is used in this case. The
		  handles manipulated for the standard Win32 streams
		  are in fact "bare handles" to their corresponding
		  Unix streams. The mode manipulation functions
		  (<function>GetConsoleMode</function> /
		  <function>SetConsoleMode</function>) are not
		  supported.
		</entry>
		<entry>
		  Implemented in server, and a specific Winelib
		  program (wineconsole) is in charge of the
		  rendering and user input. The mode manipulation
		  functions behave as expected.

      <title>Console creation</title>
      
      <para>
	The Win32 objects behind a console can be created in several occasions:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      When the program is started from wineconsole, a new
	      console object is created and will be used (inherited)
	      by the process launched from wineconsole.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      When a program, which isn't attached to a console, calls
	      <function>AllocConsole</function>, Wine then launches
	      wineconsole, and attaches the current program to this
	      console. In this mode, the USER32 mode is always
	      selected as Wine cannot tell the current state of the
	      Unix console.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	Please also note, that starting a child process with the
	<constant>CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE</constant> flag, will end-up
	calling <function>AllocConsole</function> in the child
	process, hence creating a wineconsole with the USER32 backend.
