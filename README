INSTALLATION:

Linux:

    Uncompress and untar this archive into the directory of your
choice.  This release requires a Linux version 0.99 pl13 kernel
or above.

NetBSD:

    If you use BSD make rather than GNU make, you must apply the patches
in the file "bsdmake.patch".  This release requires NetBSD-current.

All:

To build Wine, first do a "make depend" and then a "make".  The
executable "wine" will be built.  "wine" will load and run Windows'
executables.  You must have a file "wine.ini" in the current directory,
your homedirectory, or in the path specified by the environment 
variable WINEPATH. Multiple directories in WINEPATH should be seperated
by semi-colons and NOT by colons!

You must specify the entire path to the executable, or a filename only
(using the path= statement in wine.ini as the search path)

For example: to run Windows' solitaire:

	export WINEPATH=/etc;/usr/windows

	wine sol		   (using the path= statement in wine.ini
	wine sol.exe		    as the search path)

	wine c:\\windows\\sol.exe  (using a dosfilename)

	wine /usr/windows/sol.exe  (using a unixfilename)

Have a nice game of solitaire, but be careful.  Emulation isn't perfect.
So, occassionally it will crash.

    - Misc bug fixes

    - Memory DC's

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.2.1:
    - I have placed things into sub-directories.  The organization is
      not finalized.  I imagine that the directory structure will
      change as is necessary.  Files in the ./misc directory need
      to be split apart and placed in apropriate directories.
    - Tons of code from Alexandre.  He has constructed the framework
      for handling GDI objects.  He has also provided code for DCEs.
    - Local heap functions have been completed.
    - Bug fixes in global.c and win.c
    - New function GlobalQuickAlloc() combines GlobalAlloc() and
      GlobalLock() into a single function call.
    - New patch kit for Linux 0.99 pl11 kernel.  Thanks to Linus
      who has graciously included our patches into the ALPHA patch
      release cycle.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.2.0:
    - Alexandre Julliard has provided a replacement for the Tcl code.
      The new code uses Xlib and Xt directly with no intervening
      interpretted language.  This should reduce the learning
      curve for casual hackers.
    - I changed all GLOBAL_ names to Global.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.1.1:
    - I have completed global memory allocation, but I don't like it.
      It is not 100% compatible with Windows.  I need some more kernel
      modifications for 100% compatibility.
    - Alexandre Julliard has provided written better emulation for
      the Windows message queue.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.1.0:
    - Latest patches from Alexandre Julliard.
    - minor bug fix in if1632.S

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.0.5:
    - Patches from Alexandre Julliard.  Some integration with Tcl.
    - Generic interface for callback procedures.  This will allow
      callbacks into DLLs.
    - MakeProcInstance() has been implemented but untested.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.0.4:
    - Eric Youngdale modified wine.c and selector.c to allow loading
      of Windows DLLs.
    - Added global memory allocation routines (GlobalAlloc, GlobalFree,
      and GlobalLock)
    - Bitmap resource loading into global memory.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.0.3:
    - Fixed bug with sector sizes.
    - Registers at program startup are now set correctly.
    - Segment fixups for relocatable-segment internal entry points.
    - Fixed bug in DOS PSP structure.
    - Some resource loading is done.
    - Added "return" ordinal type to build program.
    - Added comment capability to build program.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.0.2:

    - Again thanks to Eric Youngdale for some very useful comments.
    - The Windows startup code created by Micrsoft C 7.0 now runs 
      to completion.
    - Added a new patch to the kernel to increase the usable size of
      the ldt to the full 32 entries currently allowed.
    - Imported name relocations are now supported.
    - Source code for my infamous test program is now included.
    - A handful of basic Windows functions are now emulated.  See
      "kernel.spec" for examples of how to use the build program.

WHAT'S NEW with version 0.0.1:

    - Eric Youngdale contributed countless improvements in memory
      efficiency, bug fixes, and relocation.
    - The build program has been completed.  It now lets you specify
      how the main DLL entry point should interface to your emulation
      library routines.  A brief description of how to build these
      specifications is included in the file "build-spec.txt".
    - The code to dispatch builtin DLL calls is complete, but untested.

TODO:

    - Segment fixup code completion.
    - Trap and handle DOS and DPMI calls.
    - GlobalAlloc of code segments.
    - Rewrite global memory support including kernel mods to allow
      application to mess with page map.
    - Handle self-loading applications.
    - Resource loading
    - Lots and lots of API fiunctions.

BUILD:

    The documentation for the build program is in the file build-spec.txt

FINALE:

Good luck,
